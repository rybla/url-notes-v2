*   **Core Technology:** Teletext encodes data, primarily text and block graphics, into the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) of an analog television signal, making it a one-way broadcast system.
*   **Competing Standards:**
    *   **World System Teletext (WST):** The British standard (Ceefax/ORACLE) that became dominant globally. It features a 40x24 character grid, "sixel" block graphics, and a 7-color palette. Level 1.5 (1981) added national character set support and is the most enduring version.
    *   **Antiope:** A technically more flexible French standard using packet-based data transmission, allowing for features like variable font sizes. It lost to WST in Europe due to market factors.
    *   **Telidon:** A Canadian standard notable for using vector graphics (PDI - Picture Description Instructions) for higher-fidelity images, but its high decoder cost limited adoption.
    *   **NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax):** The official North American standard, which was a hybrid system heavily derived from Telidon's vector graphics and Antiope's architecture.
    *   **JTES (Japanese Teletext Standard):** A technically superior Japanese standard designed for complex logographic scripts. It supported higher-resolution fonts, customizable characters (DRCS), vector and pixel graphics, and even FM/PCM audio.
*   **Global Adoption:**
    *   WST was widely adopted in Europe, becoming a staple of public service broadcasting, and was adapted for non-Latin scripts like Cyrillic and Arabic.
    *   In the US, market fragmentation and competition between standards, followed by the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act mandating a different closed captioning system, led to teletext's demise.
*   **Legacy:** Despite being technologically archaic, WST-based teletext services remain operational and popular in over 15 countries, primarily in Europe.
