*   **Problem Statement:** Modern software stacks are characterized by fragility, dependency on internet connectivity (cloud services, DRM, subscriptions), and excessive complexity. This results in a lack of user ownership, skill atrophy (e.g., learning a proprietary tool vs. a fundamental skill), and rapid "bitrot," rendering software unusable in short timeframes. This is especially acute in resource-constrained environments like the author's off-grid sailboat.
*   **Objective:** To create a resilient, long-lasting, and transparent personal computing ecosystem ("permacomputing"). The system must be simple enough to be fully understood and reimplemented by a single person from memory, runnable on old or low-power hardware, and independent of external networks or infrastructure.
*   **Methodology & Research:**
    *   The core idea is to use a custom virtual machine (VM) for portability and longevity, inspired by the durability of classic console games via emulation.
    *   An exploration of historical and esoteric systems was undertaken to find a suitable foundation:
        *   **Complex Systems (JVM, Smalltalk, Lisp):** Rejected for being too large, fractalized, or reliant on concepts like garbage collection at the VM layer, which was deemed undesirable.
        *   **Minimalist OS (Oberon, Plan 9/Inferno):** Valued for their design principles. The P-machine (Pascal) and Dis (Inferno) VMs were key inspirations, demonstrating that a simple, portable instruction set could underpin an entire OS.
        *   **Minimal Instruction Sets (OISC, Brainfuck, CHIP-8):** While simple to implement, they were either impractical (shifting complexity to the compiler), not suited for general-purpose computing, or had an undesirable programming model.
*   **Chosen Solution: A Forth-like Stack Machine:**
    *   Inspired by Chuck Moore's Forth, Machine Forth, and the J1 FPGA, a stack-based architecture was chosen for its simplicity and direct mapping to machine operations.
    *   A custom VM with a minimal set of 32 opcodes was designed. The entire specification is small enough to fit on a t-shirt, meeting the goal of being easily reproducible.
    *   The system is self-hosting; the assembler for the language is written in the language itself and compiles to a 3KB binary.
    *   The programming model is a postfix notation that is close to assembly but designed to be more readable and self-documenting.
*   **Conclusion:** The project is an argument for "permacomputing"â€”the creation of diverse, personal, and resilient systems as an alternative to the monoculture of modern, fragile software. It emphasizes that simplicity, constraint, and full-stack understanding are key to building durable technology.
