*   **Historical Precedent:** The common 80-character line limit is not merely a relic of old hardware. Its origins trace from modern formatters (like Black's 88-character default) back through 80-character terminals, teletypes, punch cards, and ultimately to the physical constraints of a typewritten page. Even pre-computing, newspapers used very narrow columns (~30 characters) to improve readability.
*   **Physiological Constraints:** Human eyes read in rapid, jerky movements called "saccades." For efficient reading, the start of the next line must be in the reader's peripheral vision to allow for an accurate saccade. Excessively long lines exceed this peripheral range, making it harder to find the next line and reducing reading speed and comprehension. Scientific research suggests an optimal range of 45-95 characters per line (CPL) for prose.
*   **Code vs. Prose Distinction:** Code's line length is effectively consumed by whitespace for indentation. A maximum line length of ~90 characters, once indented (e.g., 8-12 spaces for class/method scopes), results in an actual text width that falls within the scientifically optimal CPL range for reading.
*   **Modern Screen Utilization:** Wide screens are poorly utilized by single, long lines of text. The author advocates for using multi-column layouts (split panes in an IDE) to keep more relevant code visible simultaneously, leveraging spatial memory and mimicking the information density of newspapers or books.
*   **The "Soft-Wrap" Problem:** While theoretically ideal for allowing user-preference-based formatting, soft-wrapping is impractical because it breaks integration with fundamental, line-based development tools, most notably `diff`. Hard-wrapping is a necessary convention for interoperability.
