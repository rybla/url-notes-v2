*   **Problem:** Complex todo applications (Notion, Todoist, etc.) introduce overhead, feature-creep, and platform risk, turning system management into a form of procrastination.
*   **Solution:** A single, plain text file (`todo.txt`) for task management.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Tasks are organized under a date heading (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`).
    *   Time-sensitive items are prefixed with the time (e.g., `10am review PRs`).
    *   Contextual notes are added as indented sub-bullets.
    *   The file is a living document; completed tasks are deleted or annotated with their outcome.
    *   The historical log of entries serves as a searchable work journal.
*   **Technical Justification:**
    *   **Longevity & Portability:** The `.txt` format is universal and future-proof, independent of any single company or application.
    *   **Speed & Accessibility:** The file can be opened and edited instantly with a keyboard shortcut, eliminating app launch times and context switching.
    *   **Simplicity:** The lack of features removes distractions and forces focus on execution.
    *   **Search:** Standard text search (`Cmd+F`) is sufficient for retrieval.
    *   **Sync:** Can be synced across devices using any file synchronization service (e.g., Dropbox).
    *   **Extensibility:** Can be optionally augmented with AI text-completion tools for faster entry without creating a hard dependency.
*   **Conclusion:** A simple, self-owned text file is more efficient than feature-rich applications because its low friction encourages consistent use. It separates the act of task management from the tools used for time-based reminders, collaboration, or project management.
