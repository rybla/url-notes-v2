*   **Objective:** Unify Microsoft's consumer (Windows 9x/Me) and enterprise (Windows NT/2000) operating systems onto a single, stable NT kernel, moving away from legacy MS-DOS foundations.
*   **Precursors:** The project originated from the cancellation and merger of two separate NT-based projects:
    *   **Neptune:** The planned consumer successor to Windows Me, featuring a task-oriented UI (`Forms+`/`Mars`).
    *   **Odyssey:** The planned business successor to Windows 2000.
*   **Codename "Whistler":** The unified project, based on the Windows 2000 (NT 5.0) codebase, eventually becoming NT 5.1.
*   **UI/UX:** The iconic "Luna" visual style was not developed in-house but was created by the external firm `frog design`.
*   **Key Technical Features:**
    *   Introduced Windows Product Activation (WPA) to combat piracy, generating a hardware-based ID for license validation.
    *   Added a Compatibility Mode to allow legacy software designed for non-NT versions (95/98/Me) to run.
    *   Integrated System Restore, a feature inherited from the Neptune project and Windows Me.
    *   Bundled key software and technologies like IE6, a built-in firewall, Remote Desktop, Fast User Switching, and DirectX 8.1.
*   **Service Packs:**
    *   **SP1 (2002):** Added USB 2.0 support and the "Set Program Access and Defaults" utility.
    *   **SP2 (2004):** A major security-focused update that added the Windows Security Center, improved firewall, and native Wi-Fi/Bluetooth support.
    *   **SP3 (2008):** Final major update, adding WPA2 support and rolling up prior fixes.
*   **Legacy:** Windows XP had an exceptionally long lifecycle, remaining the dominant global OS until approximately 2012. It successfully transitioned the consumer market to the more robust NT architecture and was known for its stability and broad hardware compatibility, from Pentium II to early Core i7 processors.
