*   **Parties:** Yomiuri Shimbun (plaintiff), Japan's largest newspaper, has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the AI startup Perplexity (defendant).
*   **Allegation:** Perplexity is accused of scraping approximately 119,467 articles from Yomiuri's servers and using them to reproduce copyrighted content in response to user queries without authorization.
*   **Legal Basis:** The suit, filed in Tokyo District Court, claims Perplexity violated Japan's "right of reproduction" and "right to transmit to the public."
*   **Demands:** The lawsuit seeks nearly $15 million in damages and an injunction to compel Perplexity to stop reproducing its articles.
*   **Japanese Copyright Law Context:** A 2018 amendment allows AI model training on copyrighted material but does not permit reproduction or distribution that "unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner."
*   **Precedent & Industry Context:** This is the first such lawsuit by a major Japanese publisher against an AI company. It follows similar legal actions against Perplexity by News Corp in the U.S. and against other AI firms like OpenAI and Meta by publishers in India and France.
