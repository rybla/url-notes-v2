*   **Native Port:** The open-source 3D application Blender now runs natively on Windows 11 on Arm (WoA).
*   **Collaboration:** The port was a joint project between Microsoft, Linaro, and Qualcomm.
*   **Performance Gains:** Blender 4.5 LTS utilizes a native Vulkan backend supporting the Adreno GPU in Snapdragon X chips, resulting in performance improvements of up to 6x in viewport playback and 4.5x in rendering compared to the non-native version.
*   **Future Development:** Hardware-accelerated ray tracing for the Cycles renderer on Snapdragon X platforms is planned for a 2026 release.
*   **Configuration:** The Vulkan backend must be manually enabled in Blender's system preferences.
