*   **Construction:** The phrase "try and" + [bare verb] (e.g., "try and eat") is a form of pseudo-coordination, semantically similar to "try to" + [verb].
*   **Historical Context:** It is not a recent innovation, with attestations from the late 1500s. Evidence suggests it developed simultaneously with or even predates "try to".
*   **Syntactic Properties:** Unlike true coordination, "try and":
    *   Is not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint (i.e., it allows wh-extraction).
    *   Does not permit reordering of the conjuncts.
    *   Cannot be modified by "both".
*   **Bare Form Condition:** In most standard varieties of English, both "try" and the following verb must be uninflected (bare form).
    *   Example: `I will try and finish` is grammatical; `*He tries and finishes` is not.
    *   This constraint is weakening in some dialects (e.g., South African English), which may permit forms like `He tries and find...`.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   An adverb or negation cannot separate "try" from "and".
    *   The verb phrase following "and" cannot be elided (e.g., `*I'll try and`).
*   **Related Constructions:** Other verbs like `be sure`, `mind`, and motion verbs (`go`, `come`) can form similar pseudo-coordinations, though motion verbs exhibit different syntactic and semantic properties (e.g., they are not subject to the bare form condition and entail completion of the action).
