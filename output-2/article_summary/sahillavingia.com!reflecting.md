*   **Initial Goal:** Build a venture-backed, billion-dollar company.
*   **Funding:** Raised a $1.1M seed round followed by a $7M Series A from investors including KPCB, totaling over $8M.
*   **Growth Stall:** The company's growth rate became insufficient to justify a Series B fundraise, which required consistent >20% month-over-month growth. The addressable market was not large enough for sustained hyper-growth.
*   **Downsizing:** After a failed 9-month effort to accelerate growth, the company laid off 75% of its staff (from 20 to 5) to achieve profitability and avoid shutdown.
*   **Financial Turnaround:** The company transitioned from a monthly net loss of $351,000 (on $89k revenue) to a net profit of $10,000 (on $176k revenue) within a year by drastically cutting operating expenses.
*   **Investor Buyout:** Lead investor KPCB sold its equity back to the company for $1, reducing the liquidation preference from $16.5M to $2.5M and making a positive outcome for founders/employees feasible without a massive exit.
*   **Core Thesis:** The author concludes that market dynamics, not the pace of feature development or team execution, ultimately determined the company's growth trajectory.
*   **Shift in Strategy:** Moved from a "go-big-or-go-home" VC model to a sustainable, creator-focused business. The new focus is on creating value (impact on creators, open-sourcing) rather than capturing it (revenue, valuation).
