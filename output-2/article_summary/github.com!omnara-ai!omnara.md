- **Project:** Omnara, a platform for monitoring and interacting with AI agents.
- **Core Function:** Provides a mobile-first interface (iOS/Android/Web) for real-time visibility and control over AI agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.
- **Problem Solved:** Addresses the issue of long-running, non-interactive AI agent tasks that may get stuck awaiting user input, by externalizing the communication channel.
- **Architecture:**
    - Agents communicate with a FastAPI backend via a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) and REST API.
    - The backend uses a PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM.
    - A notification service sends alerts to user devices (mobile/web).
    - User interactions are relayed back to the agent through the API.
- **Authentication:** Utilizes a dual JWT system; Supabase for user authentication and a custom RSA-based JWT system for agent authentication.
- **Usage Modes:**
    - **Real-Time Monitoring:** A CLI wrapper (`omnara`) intercepts and forwards agent communication to the Omnara platform.
    - **Remote Launch:** A server mode (`omnara serve`) allows agents to be launched remotely via webhooks from the mobile/web application.
- **Integration:** Offers a Python SDK and a direct REST API for custom agent integration.
