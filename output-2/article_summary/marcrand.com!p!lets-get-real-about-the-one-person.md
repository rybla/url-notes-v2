*   **Thesis:** The primary barrier to a one-person, billion-dollar company is not technological limitation but the founder's psychological and physical pain tolerance.
*   **Founder Archetype:** The necessary individual is an outlier with extreme resilience and a specific skillset, akin to an elite athlete, not a typical venture-backed founder.
*   **Valuation Gap:** The author contrasts the prediction with the current closest example, Heather Cox Richardson's newsletter business (~$50M valuation), highlighting the immense gap to $1B.
*   **Viable Scenarios:**
    1.  An opportunistic, viral consumer app (e.g., Flappy Bird) sold at peak hype.
    2.  An intentional, scalable consumer platform (e.g., Instagram) built by a founder with the specific goal and ability to remain solo.
*   **Constraints:** Enterprise ventures are deemed unsuitable due to high operational overhead. The natural tendency to hire a team to improve a successful product is a significant counterforce.
