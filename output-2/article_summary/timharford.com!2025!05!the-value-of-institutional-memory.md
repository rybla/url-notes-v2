*   **Thesis:** Institutional memory is inherently fragile and its loss leads to repeated, high-cost failures. Organizations naturally forget; remembering requires continuous, active effort.
*   **Mechanisms of Forgetting:**
    *   **Knowledge Atrophy:** Expertise decays without consistent application ("forgetting by not doing"). A study on Lockheed TriStar manufacturing estimated a knowledge half-life of just over one year due to production lulls.
    *   **Record Loss:** Physical archives are vulnerable to destruction (e.g., Blitz, fire) and misplacement. Digital archives suffer from technological obsolescence and link rot.
    *   **Personnel Churn:** Departing employees take tacit knowledge with them.
    *   **Siloed Actions:** One part of an organization can be unaware of or indifferent to the actions of another, as seen in the UK's Windrush scandal where the Home Office destroyed records it would later require from citizens.
*   **Case Studies of Failure:**
    *   **NASA:** The Columbia shuttle disaster was rooted in the same systemic failures of management and risk assessment that caused the Challenger explosion, indicating a failure to retain critical safety lessons.
    *   **Volkswagen:** The 2015 emissions scandal mirrored a similar 1973 incident with the EPA, demonstrating a failure to learn from past corporate misconduct.
    *   **British Waterways:** Workers inadvertently drained a canal by removing a 200-year-old plug, the records for which had been destroyed.
*   **Conclusion:** Even institutions dedicated to preservation (e.g., Bodleian Library) struggle against the natural tendency to forget. Preventing the loss of institutional memory requires deliberate, structured processes.
