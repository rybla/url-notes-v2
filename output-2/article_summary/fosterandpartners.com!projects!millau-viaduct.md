*   **Structure Type:** Cable-stayed viaduct with multiple masts.
*   **Location:** Spans the Tarn River gorge in Southern France, completing the A75 autoroute.
*   **Design Goal:** To elegantly and economically span the 2.46km distance between two plateaux with minimal landscape intervention.
*   **Key Engineering Features:**
    *   Each of the seven sections spans 342 meters.
    *   Piers range from 75m to 245m in height.
    *   Masts extend 87m above the road deck.
    *   Columns are split and tapered below the deck into an A-frame form to manage thermal expansion/contraction of the concrete deck and reduce the visual profile.
*   **Records:** At the time of construction, it was the tallest structure in France, featured the world's highest pylons, and had the highest road bridge deck in Europe.
