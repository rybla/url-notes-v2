*   **Objective**: Measure the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens galaxy (redshift z=0.44).
*   **Methodology**: A self-consistent model combining 2D stellar dynamics (from VLT/MUSE spectroscopy) and strong gravitational lens modeling (from HST imaging). The analysis simultaneously fits the host galaxy's stellar kinematics and the lensed images of a background source, particularly a radial arc sensitive to the galaxy's inner mass structure.
*   **Primary Finding**: A 5σ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with a mass of log₁₀(M_BH/M_⊙) = 10.56 (+0.07 / -0.08) ± 0.12 (sys), which corresponds to approximately 36 billion solar masses.
*   **Significance**: The measured mass places the SMBH ~1.5σ above the established M_BH–σ_e scaling relation. This result supports an emerging trend observed in other massive galaxies, suggesting a steeper relationship at the highest masses and a potentially different co-evolutionary pathway for UMBHs and their hosts.
*   **Model Validation**: The necessity of the SMBH is confirmed by a Bayesian evidence comparison (ΔlnZ > 16), which decisively favors models including the central mass concentration over those without it. The joint lensing and dynamics analysis was shown to be crucial for breaking model degeneracies and robustly constraining the SMBH mass.
