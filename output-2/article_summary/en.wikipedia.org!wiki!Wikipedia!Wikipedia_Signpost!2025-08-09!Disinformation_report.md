*   **Subject**: An extensive investigation into a decade-long, multi-lingual self-promotion campaign on Wikipedia for artist David Woodard.
*   **Scope**: The operation involved approximately 200 sockpuppet accounts and numerous proxy IPs, resulting in the David Woodard article becoming the most translated on Wikipedia (335 languages).
*   **Methodology**:
    *   **Mass Article Creation**: A single account, `Swmmng`, created at least 92 articles, primarily low-effort machine translations. This was later supplemented by hundreds of single-purpose accounts and IP proxies following an identical *modus operandi*.
    *   **Sockpuppetry**: A core group of accounts (`Swmmng`, `BarunH`, `Judgtastic`, `BardRapt`, etc.) created and edited articles about Woodard, his wife (Sonja Vectomov), and their interests.
    *   **Content Injection**: Woodard's name and trivia were inserted into at least 93 unrelated English Wikipedia articles, a pattern replicated across other languages.
    *   **Media Uploads**: Multiple accounts uploaded photographs of Woodard, often with questionable copyright claims and exif data suggesting a close personal connection to the subject.
    *   **Deception**: Edits included deceptively altering source titles (e.g., removing "Pure Aryan") and hiding promotional additions within minor edits.
*   **Investigation & Attribution**: The campaign was uncovered by user Grnrchst, who traced the network's activity. A sockpuppet investigation confirmed the connection between the core accounts. The evidence strongly suggests the network was operated by Woodard himself or a close associate.
*   **Resolution**:
    *   A report on Wikimedia Meta led to global stewards deleting 235 articles and blocking the identified single-purpose accounts.
    *   A coordinated, decentralized response from individual Wikipedia language communities resulted in the number of articles being reduced from 335 to 20 through deletion or rewriting from scratch.
