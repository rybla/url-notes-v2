*   **Core Issue:** The Wikimedia Foundation legally challenged the UK's Online Safety Act, specifically the criteria for "Category 1" classification, which imposes the strictest regulations.
*   **Wikimedia's Position:** Argued the rules are overly broad and ill-suited for Wikipedia. Compliance would necessitate verifying the identity of its volunteer editors, which they contend would violate user privacy and safety, fundamentally undermining the encyclopedia's operational model.
*   **Legal Action:** Sought a judicial review of the government's decision-making process for the regulations, claiming it was logically flawed.
*   **High Court Ruling:** The court rejected Wikimedia's challenge to the lawfulness of the *process* by which the regulations were created.
*   **Immediate Consequence:** Wikipedia is not immediately forced to implement user verification. The ruling pertains to the legality of the regulation's creation, not its specific application to Wikipedia yet.
*   **Future Implications:** The judgment acknowledges that the communications regulator, Ofcom, is responsible for the actual classification. The ruling leaves open the possibility for future legal challenges if Ofcom decides to classify Wikipedia as Category 1, and that classification demonstrably impedes its operations.
