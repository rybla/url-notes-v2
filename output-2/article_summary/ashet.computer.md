*   **Concept:** An expandable, hackable home computer designed to be fully understandable by a single person, bridging the gap between microcontrollers (like Arduino) and single-board computers (like Raspberry Pi).
*   **Core Processor:** RP2350.
*   **Validated Prototype Features:**
    *   DVI video generation
    *   PSRAM support
    *   Backplane and expansion card communication
    *   Ethernet and I²C subsystems
    *   Capable of booting a graphical desktop OS.
*   **Project Phase:** Prototyping is complete. The project is moving into the engineering phase (schematics, PCB layout, EMI testing), which will be funded via a crowdfunding campaign.
*   **Target Price:** Sub-250€.
*   **Licensing:** The full design will be released under a permissive open-source license.
