*   **Benchmark Achievement:** Qodo Command, a CLI agent, scored 71.2% on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark.
*   **Benchmark Context:** SWE-bench evaluates AI agents on real-world software engineering tasks derived from GitHub issues in 12 open-source Python repositories. The test was performed as a single, one-shot execution using the production version of the agent without any benchmark-specific fine-tuning.
*   **Core Architecture:**
    *   **Context Summarization:** Distills complex, multi-file codebases into concise, structured summaries for the LLM.
    *   **Execution Planning:** Employs a "plan-first" strategy, breaking down user intent into subtasks before code generation.
    *   **Resilience:** Features retry and fallback mechanisms that diagnose tool errors, adjust parameters, and attempt alternative strategies.
    *   **Framework:** Built on LangGraph for modular, graph-based agent workflow orchestration.
*   **Integrated Tooling:**
    *   **FileSystem:** Standard file operations with a fuzzy matching fallback for edit operations.
    *   **Shell Tool:** Executes shell commands to run builds, linters, and test suites.
    *   **Ripgrep:** Natively integrated for fast, recursive codebase searching.
    *   **Web Search:** Available but was disabled for the benchmark run to prevent data leakage.
*   **LLM Backend:** The agent is model-agnostic, but the benchmark results were achieved using Claude 4.
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Designed for automating tasks such as code review, test generation, and documentation. It includes a UI mode for integrated code review (Qodo Merge).
*   **Availability:** The agent is publicly available via npm: `npm install -g @qodo/command`.
