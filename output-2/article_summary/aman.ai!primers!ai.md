*   **Source:** A curated list of primers on AI concepts from Aman's AI Journal.
*   **Scope:** Covers the end-to-end process of AI development, from foundational algorithms to MLOps and project management.
*   **Content Breakdown:**
    *   **Algorithms & Architectures:** Details fundamental ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes), core DL architectures (CNNs, GANs, Diffusion Models, Transformers), and advanced concepts like Mixture-of-Experts, State Space Models, and Attention mechanisms.
    *   **Data & Training:** Covers data preprocessing (sampling, normalization), training procedures (gradient descent, backprop), regularization techniques (Batchnorm, Dropout), and fine-tuning strategies (PEFT).
    *   **Specialized Fields:** Includes dedicated sections on Speech, Vision (ViT, Receptive Fields), and extensive NLP topics (Embeddings, Tokenization, RAG, LLMs, VLMs).
    *   **Evaluation & Operations:** Discusses offline/online evaluation metrics (F-Beta, A/B testing), MLOps (data drift, tooling), and on-device AI (model compression, federated learning).
    *   **Models:** Provides primers on specific, influential models including BERT, GPT, LLaMA, Gemini, and CLIP.
