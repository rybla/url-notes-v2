*   **Objective**: Design a multi-purpose work-from-home studio in a spatially-constrained Brooklyn room, supporting professional video production, music creation, and other distinct work modes.
*   **Spatial Strategy**: Employed vertical, industrial shelving to increase usable surface area beyond the room's footprint. A standing-height desk and drafting chair were used to optimize ergonomics.
*   **A/V System Design**:
    *   **Video**: A diagonal camera layout was required to achieve a professional focal length and clean background. The setup uses multiple Blackmagic Micro Studio cameras connected via SDI, controlled by a central switch.
    *   **Audio**: Sennheiser microphones are routed through a central RME audio interface, which is shared with the music production equipment.
    *   **Power**: The entire broadcast and lighting setup is powered on and off via a single switch, preserving all settings. A central board with five switches allows for granular power control of different functions.
*   **Workflow & Ergonomics**:
    *   The space was segmented into four distinct work modes, with equipment placed on shelves for optimal ergonomics rather than in dedicated physical areas.
    *   Vibration insulation was used for all audio components to mitigate interference from a nearby street and high-volume playback.
*   **Custom Solutions**:
    *   Ergotron monitor arms were used for display mounting, providing flexibility and creating additional hidden storage.
    *   A custom-fabricated, stowable dashboard for a flight simulator was built with a soft-close mechanism.
*   **Infrastructure**: The final setup required the installation and management of nearly 700 feet of cabling.
