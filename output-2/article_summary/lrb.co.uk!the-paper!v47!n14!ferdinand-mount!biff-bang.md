*   **Historical Context:**
    *   Ancient tariffs (Greek, Roman) were primarily for revenue (1-5%), not protectionism. Classical thinkers like Plato and Aristotle viewed trade with suspicion, preferring national self-sufficiency (_autarkeia_).
    *   Protectionism as a tool of national policy emerged in early modern Europe. It was central to English policy from the 16th to 18th centuries (e.g., Navigation Acts) and French mercantilism under Colbert, which was linked to state cronyism.
    *   US protectionism was a foundational policy, advocated by Alexander Hamilton in his "Report on Manufactures" and embedded in the "American System." Tariff disputes were a significant cause of internal friction, contributing to events like the Nullification Crisis and the Civil War.

*   **Modern Protectionism (Trump/Lighthizer):**
    *   Trump's tariff policies are presented as a return to historical US norms, echoing the Hoover administration.
    *   Proponents like Robert Lighthizer argue the "unprecedented" policy was the post-1990s era of free trade and China's admission to the WTO, which they claim led to US manufacturing job losses.
    *   The critique of this position is its lack of economic evidence; the article cites data showing Trump's 2018 steel tariffs failed to increase jobs and negatively impacted overall GDP.

*   **Economic Analysis & Counterarguments:**
    *   The post-WWII period (1945-1993), governed by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), is cited as an era of unprecedented global prosperity driven by freer trade.
    *   Tariff wars are highly disruptive to modern complex global supply chains. Examples include:
        *   **Semiconductors:** A hyper-globalized product, often crossing 70+ borders. Reshoring efforts like the CHIPS Act are described as likely futile and costly.
        *   **Soybeans:** A globally integrated commodity where tariffs create widespread disruption.
        *   **Steel:** Global oversupply and the potential for recycling via electric arc furnaces present more effective solutions than tariffs for ailing industries.
    *   Job losses attributed to globalization are argued to be more directly caused by automation and the failure of governments to implement compensatory policies for affected communities (a lack of a "New New Deal").

*   **Nuances and Concessions:**
    *   Even free-trade proponents like Adam Smith acknowledged a potential role for temporary tariffs to protect "infant industries" or to phase out protectionism slowly to prevent mass job loss.
    *   John Maynard Keynes briefly advocated for national self-sufficiency during the Great Depression.
    *   Tariffs can be effective in protecting specific niche markets, such as the 25% tariff on small trucks in the US.
