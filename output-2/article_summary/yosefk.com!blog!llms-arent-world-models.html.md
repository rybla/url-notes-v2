*   **Core Thesis:** LLMs are not "world models"; they do not build internal, coherent representations of the concepts, rules, and relationships described in their training data. Their proficiency stems from next-token prediction, not genuine understanding.

*   **Evidence from Failure Cases:**
    *   **Chess:** An LLM fails to learn the fundamental requirement of tracking piece positions to make legal moves, despite being trained on vast numbers of games. It loses track of the board state when faced with novel, weak moves not found in its training data.
    *   **Image Blending:** An LLM incorrectly claims that "Normal" alpha blending is not a mathematical formula, demonstrating a failure to model basic concepts like digital color representation, transparency, and calculation.
    *   **Logical Contradiction:** When presented with a query about the associativity of alpha blending and its implications for caching, the LLM agrees with contradictory premises, showing it cannot reason about the logical relationship between the concepts.
    *   **Language Design Principles:** An LLM incorrectly and stubbornly argues that removing Python's GIL is *designed* to make the language memory-unsafe like C. It misinterprets bug reports (which are contrary evidence) as supporting its claim, failing to model the core principle of Python's memory safety.

*   **Predictions:**
    *   A future ML breakthrough will be required to create true "world models" capable of learning novel systems generically.
    *   LLMs are an insufficient path to AGI.
    *   LLMs will not be able to autonomously manage large codebases, as this requires a coherent model of the program's logic.
    *   They will never reliably distinguish between what they "know" and what they are fabricating, as this requires a model of truth itself.
