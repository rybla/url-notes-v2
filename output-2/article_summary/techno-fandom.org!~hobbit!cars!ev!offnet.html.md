*   **Objective:** Achieve a "dark" state for a Kona EV by completely disconnecting it from Hyundai's Bluelink network.
*   **Motivation:** Eliminate the risk of remote tracking, data collection, and unauthorized vehicle interference by the manufacturer, which the author considers a significant privacy and security vulnerability.
*   **Method:**
    *   Initial step: Refused dealer activation of the Bluelink service.
    *   Primary technical goal: Physically locate and disable the vehicle's cellular telematics unit to sever its data connection capabilities entirely.
