- **Core Concept:** Use Markdown for text content and embed Web Components (as Custom Elements) for complex, reusable UI components.
- **Mechanism:**
    - A server-side Markdown processor (e.g., Markdig, Marked) parses the text, converting Markdown syntax to HTML.
    - The processor is configured to ignore standard HTML tags, leaving the Custom Element tags (e.g., `<subscribe-to>`) untouched in the output.
    - The browser receives the mixed HTML, then processes and expands the Custom Elements into their full DOM structures via client-side JavaScript.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Abstraction:** Authors can use simple, declarative tags in Markdown to represent complex components without writing verbose HTML.
    - **Separation of Concerns:** Content creation (Markdown) is decoupled from component implementation (JavaScript/Web Components).
    - **Extensibility:** Creates a powerful "macro" system where Markdown handles text formatting and Custom Elements handle structural/interactive components.
- **Technical Considerations:**
    - **Invalid Syntax:** Custom Elements cannot be self-closing (`<my-tag />`). They require an explicit closing tag (`<my-tag></my-tag>`).
    - **Parser Limitations:** Some Markdown parsers struggle with multi-line attributes on HTML tags.
    - **Preprocessing:** A build-step preprocessor can be used to automatically fix issues like self-closing tags or multi-line attributes before the content is passed to the Markdown parser.
- **Alternative Architectures:**
    - **Client-Side Rendering:** Process the Markdown on the client inside a dedicated Web Component (e.g., `<md-block>`).
    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Render the Custom Elements into static HTML on the server (supported by libraries like Lit), which can be "re-hydrated" on the client to add interactivity.
