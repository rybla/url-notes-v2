Today, we are announcing [**Neki**](https://neki.dev/) — sharded Postgres by the team behind [Vitess](https://vitess.io/). Vitess is one of PlanetScale’s greatest strengths and contemporary Vitess is the product of our experience running at extreme scale. We have made explicit sharding accessible to hundreds of thousands of people and it is time to bring this power to Postgres.

Neki is not a fork of Vitess. Vitess’ achievements are enabled by leveraging MySQL’s strengths and engineering around its weaknesses. To achieve Vitess’ power for Postgres we are architecting from first principles and building alongside design partners at scale. When we are ready we will release Neki as an open source project suitable for running the most demanding Postgres workloads.
