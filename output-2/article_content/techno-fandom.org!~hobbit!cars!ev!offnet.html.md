# Kona EV: no more Bluelink

  The Yuppie Button page talks about making lots of light.  Now I needed to do the opposite, by "going dark" -- to vanish completely from Hyundai's data network, and avoid having the car being tracked or actively interfered with outside of my control.  See, this is one of the showstopping problems I have with Tesla -- they \*insist\* that you have your car online all the time, talking to Tesla's cloud and sending telematic data.  Thank you, NO.  The [range of things](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/bluelink/index.aspx) that Hyundai's BlueLink setup is able to do remotely to someone's car given only a VIN is totally scary.  Not only did I want no parts of that, we all have every right to not participate in that nonsense if we so choose.

As a first step I refused to let the dealer sign me for BlueLink, telling them that I could handle signup later myself if I wanted to.  But I knew there was more to it, since the car as it came was still able to make a cellular data connection and send information about itself.  The obvious question was to find and disable the cellular communication facility, or "telematics unit" as it is implemented in many vehicles.
