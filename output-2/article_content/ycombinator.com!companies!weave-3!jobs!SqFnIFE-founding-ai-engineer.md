# Founding AI Engineer at Weave | Y Combinator

At Weave, we’re building the best software for the best engineering teams to move faster, and we want to hire exceptional engineers to help us do so.

We are a well-funded startup, backed by top investors, growing rapidly and currently profitable.

You'll be working directly with me (Andrew), the CTO. Before I was CTO of Weave I was the founding engineer at Causal, and I want to give you all the support and growth opportunities in this role that I got when I went through it.

You’ll also be working directly with Adam, the CEO. Adam runs sales at Weave, and before that worked as a sales executive at a few different high growth startups.

### Must haves

You are a good fit for Weave if you are a [formidable](https://paulgraham.com/convince.html) engineer. This means you stop at nothing to accomplish your goal. We don't care much about your current skills or even what you've done before; we care that you will be able to do anything you set your mind to.

You must also be pragmatic. Weave is a startup so something is always on fire. You need to know when to let little fires burn and when to break out the extinguisher.

You must be a very good engineer who's committed to becoming a great engineer. The slope is more important than the Y-intercept.

You must be empathetic. We're building products for other people, so you need to be able to understand how other people think and why.

You must care about helping other software engineering teams be great. If that's not an exciting mission for you, it will be hard to stay motivated through the inevitable highs and lows.

You must be an excellent communicator. You’ll be working on a product that’s communicating with millions of engineers and leaders, so you need to be clear.

Finally you must be gritty. You should be accustomed to picking the hard option and pushing through it.

### Nice to haves

(Please feel free to apply even if some or all of these don't apply to you!)

Our tech stack is React + TypeScript on the frontend, Go on the backend, and Python for ML. Experience with any of those three languages is a bonus.

If you've already done lots of thinking about engineering productivity and how to improve it, that's great and we want to hear about it!

We hope your design sensibilities are passable.

### The role

As Weave’s founding AI engineer, your job is to build AI to understand and improve the work that software engineers do. You’ll be building our processes and standards as you go to make building every incremental feature easier. Your goal will be to delight customers with intelligence that makes their job 10x easier.
