# Apple-1 Registry

\= location, \= [batch](https://www.apple1registry.com/en/theapple1.html#batch), [numbers/stamps/labels](https://www.apple1registry.com/en/theapple1.html#serial), \= verification status, \= picture and video count, = available history, [\= auctions](https://www.apple1registry.com/en/market.html#auctions).  
**'More or less verified':** To the best of our knowledge and belief, evidence is almost given or obvious. Many times the current owner is unknown, pictures might be old, etc.!  
**Unlisted Apple-1:** The Apple-1 Registry is in contact with some owners who wish to have no information published. We respect this. Unknown Apple-1 might exist as well.  
**Naming:** Because there is no serial number on all Apple-1, every Apple-1 has a unique name. The name of the Apple-1 should be the first owner; if not available, the name of the last owner or last known location. Last resort is the sequential number.  
**Working condition:** Most Apple-1 could be operational again – depending on how much effort you spend or how many parts you are willing to change.  
**Last operation:** The year of last operation is not listed for good reason. After every power-up, no Apple-1 owner would announce this to the Apple-1 Registry, and this information would become obsolete very soon.  
**Accuracy:** No guarantee can be given for the accuracy of any information. If you have more information, please feel free to [contact](https://www.apple1registry.com/en/contact.html) us. Many very good replicas of Apple-1 exist, even with date code–correct components. Anyone interested in buying an Apple-1 has to keep this in mind. Hobbyists usually build replicas for private use. Even some museums use replicas.  
**Auction:** Only successful auctions since the year 2000 are considered.  
**Production:** All Apple-1 were produced in two batches in spring and fall 1976. There was **no serial number** issued by Apple. Apple Computer supplied only the mainboard, Cassette Interface Adapter, and manuals. No case, power supply, or keyboard. The Apple-1 was the first Apple computer and the beginning of a success story.  
**Number of existing Apple-1:** It may look like many Apple-1 are available, but it's getting harder to buy an Apple-1 every year. Many Apple-1 are now owned by museums or companies and will never be for sale again. In the coming years, more and more Apple-1 will 'disappear' from the market, because fewer Apple-1s will have private owners. Someday it will be nearly impossible to buy an Apple-1.  
**Lost Apple-1:** Some information about destroyed or lost Apple-1 exists. More about it [here](https://www.apple1registry.com/en/theapple1.html#lost).

**Last update:** Jul 29, 2025. [Change log](https://www.apple1registry.com/en/changelog.html) for all Apple-1.  
**Technical info:** For much better performance, all pictures are significantly reduced in size by the admin using efficient compression tools for pictures shown on the web.
