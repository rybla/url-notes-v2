# Let's get real about the one-person billion dollar company

_If you like this post, follow my journey on Twitter: [https://x.com/random](https://x.com/random)_

**The biggest hurdle to the one-person billion dollar company is not AI capability, but founder pain tolerance.**

Sam Altman is betting on it in his private group chats.

Dario Amodei predicted it'll happen in 2026.

These geniuses think the one-person billion dollar company is inevitable, and unicorn teams are getting smaller, but a _one_ person?

That‚Äôs not going to _just happen_.

One person is an intentional choice by an individual with a particular set of skills.

It's Alex Honnold free-soloing El Capitan.

It's David Goggins running an ultramarathon on broken feet.

**The unicorn founders I know can‚Äôt even manage their email on their own, so who are we talking about here?**

The person likely closest to the milestone today is Heather Cox Richardson, who could easily replace her two copy editors with Claude.

Her newsletter reportedly brings in [$12 million / year](https://growthinreverse.com/heather-cox-richardson/) and a revenue multiple of 2-4x typical for newsletters values her business at ~$50 million.

A far cry from 1 billion.

Touching that B will likely require an app with recurring revenue and network effects, that can justify higher revenue multiples.

**If it‚Äôs doable, it will probably be by:**

1.  **Someone with a Flappy Bird product that goes vertical and sells at the top, or**
    
2.  **Someone with an Instagram product who both ‚Äúcalls their shot‚Äù from the beginning and has the desire + technical ability to follow through on it.**
    

Anything outside of consumer is highly unlikely. Enterprise money comes with enterprise headaches which will absolutely destroy a solo founder.

But let‚Äôs be honest:  
**  
If you‚Äôre lucky enough to build something many people love, you‚Äôll want to hire if for no other reason than to make the product as great as it can be.**

Maybe there‚Äôs a way to do it by only hiring agencies, which technically are a form of automation, but not in the spirit of Sam and Dario‚Äôs prediction.

Let‚Äôs see! The future is exciting üöÄ
