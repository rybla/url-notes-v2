# Yale Grammatical Diversity Project: English in North America

**  
I'm gonna try and change the course of hip hop again.  
**

(Dr. Dre)

Typically, _try_ can be followed by three kinds of phrases: a noun phrase (1a), an infinitival verb phrase with _to_ (1b), or a verb phrase with -_ing_ (1c).

> 1) a. I'll try the salad.
> 
> b. I'll try to eat this horrible salad.
> 
> c. I'll try adding vinegar to the salad, to improve the taste.

However, _try_ can also combine with the conjunction _and_, followed by a bare verb form:

> 2) I’ll try and eat the salad.

This usage is very similar in meaning to _try to_, if not identical, but is deemed prescriptively incorrect (Routledge 1864:579 in D. Ross 2013a:120; Partridge 1947:338, Crews et al. 1989:656 in Brook & Tagliamonte 2016:320). In the next few sections, we will see that it has a number of interesting properties.

## Who says this?

_Try and_ is described as more prevalent in British English than American English, but is common in both varieties (Hommerberg & Tottie 2007). Brook & Tagliamonte (2016) show that Canadian speakers pattern with American speakers in their usage of the construction.

_Try and_ is not a recent innovation – it first emerged in the late 1500s, although the earliest textual attestion is from 1390 (Tottie 2012, D. Ross 2013a). Tottie (2012) provides some examples of _try and_ from EEBO-TCP corpus, including this one:

> 3) ...howe and by what certaine and generall rule I mighte **trye and** throughly discerne the veritie of the catholike faithe, from the falsehood of wicked heresye... (1554)  
> 4) You maie (saide I) **trie and** bring him in, and shewe him to her. (1569)

_Webster’s Dictionary_ (1989:919) suggests that _try and_ in fact predates _try to_, and this conclusion is supported by Hommerberg & Tottie (2007:60), Tottie & Hoffman (2011) and Tottie (2012). However, D. Ross (2013a) disputes this, saying that “_\[t\]ry and_ and _try to_ developed simultaneously and independently”. What is clear is that _try and_ has been around for at least as long as _try to_.

## Syntactic Properties

Carden & Pesetsky (1977:86) note that _try and_ does not behave like a regular case of coordination.

### Question words are allowed

One property of ‘true’ coordination is that it is subject to the _Coordinate Structure Constraint_ (J. Ross 1967), which states that a _wh_\-word cannot move out of one of the conjuncts. This is shown in (5).

> 5) a. Mary \[met Bill and ignored Susie\].
> 
> b. \*Who did Mary \[meet Bill and ignore \_\_\]?

However, a _wh_\-word can happily be moved out of a _try and structure:_

> 6) Who did Mary \[try and talk to \_\_\]?

### No reordering

A second property of pseudo-coordination that distinguishes it from regular coordination is that the two conjuncts cannot be reordered. In (6), we see that regular coordination permits the order of conjuncts to be changed, while in (7) we see that the same is not possible with _try and_ (De Vos 2005:59).

> 7) a. John will wash the bathroom and kill mosquitos.
> 
> b. John will kill mosquitos and wash the bathroom.

> 8) a. John will try and kill mosquitos.
> 
> b. \*John will kill mosquitos and try.

### _Both_ is not possible

Another piece of evidence that _try and_ is not regular coordination structure comes from the unavailability of _both_. Usually, coordinated verb phrases can be preceded by _both_:

> 9) _Reality is Broken_ will both \[stimulate your brain and stir your soul\]. \[[source](https://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/), February 28 2017\]

However, De Vos (2005:59) points out that _try and_ may not be preceded by _both_:

> 10) a. John will try and kill mosquitos.
> 
> b. \*John will both try and kill mosquitos.

### Bare form only

Unlike with regular coordination, _try and_ is available only when both _try_ and the verb following _and_ are uninflected, which means it must occur in its bare form. Carden & Pesetsky (1977) call this the _bare form condition_. The following examples are adapted from D. Ross (2013a:111):

> 11) a. I will try and finish the assignment.
> 
> b. I try and finish an assignment every day.
> 
> c. \*I tried and finish(ed) the assignment.
> 
> d. \*He tries and finish(es) an assignment every day.
> 
> e. \*It’s tough when you’re trying and finish(ing) an assignment under pressure.

### Dialect variation in the Bare Form Condition

Is the bare form condition universal? D. Ross (2013a:124-5) notes that it has weakened in some dialects, though not necessarily in the same way. In dialects of Northeastern Canada, parallel inflected forms are acceptable:

> 12) They tries and does that.

In South African English, on the other hand, _try_ may be inflected while the second verb remains a bare form (examples from D. Ross 2013a:125):

> 13) a. Noeleen tries and find answers and solutions. \[[source](http://www.tvsa.co.za/default.asp?blogname=coming_up_on_3Talk&ArticleID=2903), August 2006\]
> 
> b. We’re trying and get across that nature is harsh but not necessarily full of malice and cruelty. (Dereck Joubert on “Wild about Africa,” Carte Blanche: March 18, 2007)

### No separation of _try_ and _and_

There are some other restrictions on the distribution of try and. Unlike with _try to_, _try_ may not be separated from _and_ by an adverb (Webster’s Dictionary 1989:919):

> 14) a. Try always to tell the truth.
> 
> b. \*Try always and tell the truth.

Similarly, _try_ may not be separated from _and_ by negation (Brook & Tagliamonte 2016:308):

> 15) a. You try not to let it bother you.
> 
> b. \*You try not and let it bother you.

### No ellipsis allowed

_Try and_ is incompatible with ellipsis of the following verb phrase (Brook & Tagliamonte 2016):

> 16) a. Sure, I'll try to.
> 
> b. \*Sure, I'll try and.

## Other instances of pseudocoordination

Infinitival _to_ can be replaced by _and_ in several other cases, subject to dialectal and individual variation. Brook & Tagliamonte (2016:302) state that the best candidate for a verb phrase that behaves like _try_ is _be sure_:

> 17) Be sure and visit Harry tomorrow. (Carden & Pesetsky 1977:84)

D. Ross (2013a:122) provides several examples of other verb phrases in which infinitival _to_ has been replaced with _and_:

> 18) a. **Mind and** get all right for next Saturday. (Poutsma 1905:361)
> 
> b. You know I go to all these different schools and I **start and** get mixed up after a while. (Hopper 2002:162)
> 
> c. **Remember and** wash your hair. (BNC: KE4 636, 1992)

Another instance of pseudocoordination is found with motion verbs, such as _come_ and _go_:

> 19) a. Can you come and pick me up from the station?
> 
> b. I’ll go and get the mop.

D. Ross (2013b) argues that motion verb pseudocoordination has a different syntax and semantics from _try and_ pseudocoordination. Syntactically, we can see that motion verb pseudocoordination is _not_ subject to the bare form condition:

> 20) a. He came and **picked** me up from the station.
> 
> b. She goes and **gets** lunch every day at noon.

Semantically, _go and_ entails that the event was completed, so in (21) below it is strange to use _go and_ if the book was not acquired. In contrast, its non-pseudocoordination equivalent _go to_ does not have this entailment.

> 21) The man will go to/\*and buy the book, even if it is sold out.
