## Tilf — Pixel Art Editor

[](#tilf--pixel-art-editor)

Tilf (Tiny Elf) is a simple yet powerful pixel art editor built with PySide6. It’s designed for creating sprites, icons, and small 2D assets with essential tools, live preview, undo/redo, and export options.

[![Tilf](https://github.com/danterolle/tilf/raw/main/assets/icon.ico "Tilf")](https://github.com/danterolle/tilf/blob/main/assets/icon.ico)

There are several Pixel Art Editors that do the same things and even much more, but many require an account registration or the insertion of an e-mail or have a certain business model.

I'm _not_ interested in all that, my goal is to be able to create sprites freely, with (almost) zero dependencies, zero setup time, zero installations:

Tilf starts and I begin to draw what I want.

It runs on Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux.

I’m aware that the code quality isn’t great. I didn’t prioritize it when writing this. This project was something I put together during my spare time, and a lot of it could be written much better. There's definitely room for improvement, so I'm more than happy to accept PRs from anyone willing to contribute.

#### Why doesn't this tool have many commits?

[](#why-doesnt-this-tool-have-many-commits)

Because I mainly used it for learning and personal purposes. Publish it as an Open Source project might be interesting for others as well.

## Requirements

[](#requirements)

*   Python 3, virtualenv
*   OS: Windows, MacOS or GNULinux
*   Dependencies:
    *   PySide6
    *   PyInstaller

I did not use uv or poetry for this project; I don't think it is necessary to introduce a tool of that kind for a project that is, all things considered, simple.

## Build on MacOS and GNU/Linux

[](#build-on-macos-and-gnulinux)

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/danterolle/tilf.git && cd tilf
    

2.  This project has a [Makefile](https://github.com/danterolle/tilf/blob/main/Makefile) that automates all the necessary build and cleanup operations for Tilf (for MacOS and GNU/Linux only), so we just need to run:

    make
    

3.  The executable will be in the `dist` folder.

    ./tilf
    

Enjoy!

## About Windows

[](#about-windows)

### Run from source

[](#run-from-source)

1.  Clone the repository by using Git Bash:

    git clone https://github.com/danterolle/tilf.git
    

    cd tilf
    

2.  Create a virtual environment:

    py.exe -m venv env
    

3.  Activate the virtual environment:

    ./env/Scripts/activate
    

4.  Install the dependencies:

    pip install pyside6 pyinstaller pillow
    

Note:

5.  And finally, run the application:

    py.exe ./main.py
    

### Build executable .exe

[](#build-executable-exe)

1.  Clone the repository by using Git Bash:

    git clone https://github.com/danterolle/tilf.git
    

    cd tilf
    

    ./env/Scripts/activate
    

2.  Install the dependencies:

    pip install pyside6 pyinstaller pillow
    

3.  Run PyInstaller:

    pyinstaller --name tilf --onefile --windowed --icon assets/icon.icns --add-data assets:assets --add-data style.qss:. main.py
    

4.  The executable will be in the `dist` folder.

    ./tilf
    

## Keyboard Shortcuts for file operations

[](#keyboard-shortcuts-for-file-operations)

*   File:
    *   New: Ctrl+N
    *   Open: Ctrl+O
    *   Save: Ctrl+S
*   Edit:
    *   Undo: Ctrl+Z
    *   Redo: Ctrl+Y
*   Tools:
    *   Pencil: B
    *   Eraser: E
    *   Bucket: G
    *   Eyedropper: I
    *   Rectangle: R
    *   Ellipse: C
*   Shapes:
    *   Constrain to square/circle: hold Shift

## Save and Auto-Save

[](#save-and-auto-save)

*   Export formats:
    *   PNG: optionally keep transparency.
    *   JPEG/JPG, BMP: no transparency.

On close, if there are unsaved changes, a recovery _.png_ is automatically saved into a **tilf\_autosaves** folder next to the startup script, with a timestamped filename.

## Tips and Known Limits

[](#tips-and-known-limits)

*   [Undo/Redo history is capped at 50 states to limit memory usage](https://github.com/danterolle/tilf/blob/main/pixel_canvas.py#L31).
*   Large flood fills may take longer on big images.
*   The grid appears when zoom (cell size) is at least 4.
*   Very large images may impact performance; Remember: _Tilf targets compact pixel art and sprites_.

## Troubleshooting - Work In Progress

[](#troubleshooting---work-in-progress)

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PySide6'

[](#modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-pyside6)

Ensure your virtualenv is active and run: pip install pyside6

## Contributing

[](#contributing)
