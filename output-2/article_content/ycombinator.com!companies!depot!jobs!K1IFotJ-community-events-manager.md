## About the role

Depot is growing rapidly and reinventing the software build space. We’re looking for a Community & Events Manager to own our real-world developer presence from small scrappy meetups to major trade shows.

This isn’t a polished field marketing role. You’re not coordinating keynote stages or passing off ideas to an agency. You’re the one planning developer happy hours, running trade show booths end-to-end, and figuring out how to create moments that developers actually care about.

You’ll own our IRL presence. That includes two to three major trade shows each year, a rotating calendar of smaller developer events, and any opportunity to deepen our presence and trust in the communities that matter, online and off.

### **What you’ll do**

*   Own Depot’s entire in-person event strategy, from small developer meetups to our 2–3 major trade shows each year
*   Manage every trade show detail end-to-end including logistics, booth setup, demo flow, messaging, staffing, swag, and real developer engagement
*   Plan and run developer gatherings like happy hours, unconferences, or fringe events around larger industry moments
*   Build scalable playbooks for scrappy IRL events, so we can move fast and replicate what works
*   Work with design to bring physical spaces and swag to life in ways that feel native to developer culture
*   Identify and grow our presence in developer spaces we don’t yet own
*   Keep us ahead of what’s happening in the community: what events are worth attending, where our voice matters, and who we should be collaborating with
*   Track and report on event impact, not just in lead gen but in presence, credibility, and developer buzz
*   Build lasting relationships with developers by showing up consistently and creating experiences they’ll actually remember

### **Skills & Experience**

*   3+ years experience running developer-focused events, including trade shows, meetups, or other in-person activations
*   Proven ability to manage complex logistics, tight timelines, and shifting priorities without losing the thread on experience quality
*   Strong familiarity with developer culture and community dynamics
*   Comfortable working cross-functionally to bring events to life
*   Clear communicator who can keep stakeholders aligned without overcomplicating things
*   Prior experience at a startup or in a fast-moving environment is a plus
*   Self-starter with prior startup or fast-moving team experience, comfortable operating remotely and asynchronously

### **Depot values and culture**

We are a fully remote and globally distributed team across the US, Europe, and Canada. As a startup focused on iteration speed and technical depth, we care deeply about how people work together.

*   **We look for self starters.** Part of working in a startup is being able to self navigate the ambiguity and take meaningful action to keep the momentum moving forward. There is no shortage of fun, hard, interesting things to work on, but you need to be self motivated to pick them up and go.
*   **We’re transparent.** We do not hide how the business is doing or what the tradeoffs are. Internally and externally, we tell the truth about how things work and where they break.
*   **We’re data driven.** We track performance to the second. We ship benchmarks with methodology. A decision without data is just a theory.
*   **We’re relentlessly helpful.** We meet developers where they are and help them move faster. Inside the company, we take the same approach with each other.
*   **We do more with less.** We maximize impact through efficiency and resourcefulness. We value folks who can ruthlessly prioritize and take action. Constraints drive innovation, not limitation.
*   **We’re not your family.** We’re a team. We expect you to get things done and contribute meaningfully, and also to protect your time, rest, and personal life. Balance matters.

## About Depot

Depot is a build acceleration and developer productivity platform that saves companies like PostHog, Wistia, Semgrep, and Secoda thousands of hours in build time every week.

We are developers. We started Depot because we were frustrated with the constant pain of slow build performance. We were fed up waiting for builds and annoyed by the lack of tooling and providers that actually made builds performant. So, we went and built the solution we had always wanted.

Slow builds are the dam standing in the way between mediocrity and innovation. They’re wasteful, expensive, and a drain on developer happiness & productivity. They slow down innovation.

Taking a 40-minute build down to a minute, changes everything. We help folks save literal years in build time every single week.

And we’re just getting started. For us, it’s all about iteration speed and keeping developers in their flow state. **Our mission is to be relentless in accelerating software development.**
