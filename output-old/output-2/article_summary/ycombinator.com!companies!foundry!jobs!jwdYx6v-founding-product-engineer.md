*   **Company:** Foundry (YC S24) is developing a foundational platform to train, test, and deploy AI agents for automating browser-based digital work.
*   **Problem:** Existing AI agents are brittle and fail when encountering complex, real-world web scenarios, lacking a robust environment for development and evaluation.
*   **Solution:** A high-fidelity simulation platform, analogous to Waymo's simulation for autonomous vehicles, that provides a deterministic environment for building and benchmarking reliable web agents.
*   **Core Features:**
    *   Deterministic web simulation with versioned snapshots for reproducible testing.
    *   Live web evaluation to handle dynamic content, UI drift, and captchas.
    *   Automated annotation and labeling to generate high-quality training data.
    *   Reinforcement Learning (RL) based optimization loops for improving agent models.
*   **Role:** Founding Product Engineer.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Architect the core browser simulation engine.
    *   Design and build evaluation/benchmarking frameworks.
    *   Develop the full-stack platform (internal and external tools).
    *   Establish foundational engineering practices (CI/CD, testing, monitoring).
*   **Tech Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Go, Rust.
    *   **Frontend:** React/Next.js (TypeScript).
    *   **Core Technologies:** WebSockets, Playwright/Puppeteer, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ.
    *   **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD on GCP/AWS.
