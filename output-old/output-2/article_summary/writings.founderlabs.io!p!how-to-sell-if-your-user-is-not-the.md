*   **Core Problem:** Addresses the sales challenge where the end-user of a product (e.g., a developer) is not the financial buyer (e.g., a CTO).
*   **Central Thesis:** The sales strategy depends on identifying who holds the actual power, which is dictated by the organization's primary constraints, not necessarily the budget holder.
    *   **Constraint: Time-to-Market (e.g., Startups):** The user (developer) holds the power. Their incentive is speed. The adoption path is often bottom-up, starting with free tiers (a "Trojan Horse" approach).
    *   **Constraint: Security/Compliance (e.g., Enterprise):** The buyer (leadership) holds the power. The sales process is top-down, longer, and focuses on risk mitigation over developer experience.
*   **Actionable Strategy (for user-driven adoption):**
    *   Treat the end-user as your internal salesperson.
    *   Identify the distinct incentives for both the user (e.g., personal productivity, looking effective) and the buyer (e.g., achieving company goals, ROI).
    *   Equip the user with tools to justify the purchase to leadership. This involves translating user-centric value (e.g., "saves me time") into buyer-centric metrics (e.g., "a report showing quantifiable hours saved and accelerated project timelines").
    *   Conduct user interviews to understand and remove friction from their internal approval process.
