*   **Prevalence Underestimation:** Historical estimates, such as a 1-in-a-million frequency of incest from 1975, are now understood to be dramatic underestimates.
*   **Genetic Detection:** Widespread consumer DNA testing is providing a more accurate measure of prevalence. An unpublished analysis of the U.K. Biobank found 1 in 7,000 individuals were born to first-degree relatives (parent-child or sibling-sibling).
*   **Runs of Homozygosity (ROH):** The primary genetic indicator for incest is the presence of long "runs of homozygosity"â€”stretches where the DNA inherited from both parents is identical.
    *   In individuals born to first-degree relatives, ROH constitutes approximately 25% of the genome.
    *   This is a significant increase from the <1% typically seen in Western populations.
*   **Health Risks:** The high percentage of ROH increases the probability of expressing recessive genetic diseases. However, adverse health outcomes are probabilistic and not guaranteed, depending entirely on whether the homozygous regions contain disease-causing mutations.
*   **Discovery Mechanism:** Major testing services like AncestryDNA and 23andMe do not directly report findings of incest. Individuals typically uncover their origins by uploading raw DNA data to third-party genealogy sites that analyze for high ROH.
*   **Demographics:** Cases are found across all socioeconomic strata. The majority of identified cases involve father-daughter or older brother-younger sister pairings, indicating a strong correlation with child sexual abuse.
