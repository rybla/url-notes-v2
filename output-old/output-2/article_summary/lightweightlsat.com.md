*   **Core Philosophy**: The LSAT is a skills-based, not knowledge-based, exam. Success hinges on mastering fundamental, reusable skills rather than memorizing exhaustive rules for every question type.
*   **Target Audience**: Ambitious students aiming for scores above 165 who find traditional, high-volume study methods ineffective.
*   **Proposed Method**: A "lightweight" approach focusing on two flexible tools:
    1.  **Patterns**: Recognizing and memorizing common logical structures and question formats to improve efficiency.
    2.  **Skills**: Deliberate practice of core abilities for each test section.
*   **Fundamental Skills Breakdown**:
    *   **Reading Comprehension**: Identifying an author's stance (pro or con).
    *   **Logical Reasoning**: Deconstructing arguments by separating premises (facts) from the conclusion.
*   **Study Recommendations**:
    *   Focus on perfecting a repeatable process for each question.
    *   Use practice questions to experiment with and adapt strategies.
    *   Start with easy questions and no time pressure, gradually increasing difficulty.
    *   Treat results as informational feedback, not a judgment of self-worth.
    *   Anticipate non-linear progress (plateaus, dips, and jumps).
