## Our Vision

> "Whenever I see a new person who blogs every day, it's very rare that that never goes anywhere or they don't get good. That's like my best leading indicator for who's going to be a good blogger."

If you want to be excellent at something, it's extremely useful to do it every day. Athletes, musicians, and writers famously live by this advice. Separately, one of the world's strongest motivators is to be surrounded by ambitious, like-minded people.

For the month of November, we're running a residency for talented writers to hone their craft by writing and **publishing a blogpost every single day**. We provide food and housing at-cost, so that you can focus on writing.

We'll offer whatever we can to improve the writing experience and help the resident writers grow stronger. In fact, we've interviewed many successful writers about what's helped them, and we'll aim to offer many of the things they described, through mentorship opportunities from celebrated writers, craft-honing workshops, and professional feedback. But all that will be optional. **Your commitments are simply to be here and write.**

Note: In the quote above, Scott Alexander makes an observation about a correlation he has observed. With this program we will be [Goodharting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) on that correlation. Hopefully increasing the leading variable will produce more of the lagging variable, but of course, perhaps it will merely bring the correlation to zero.

## Writing Activities

### Giving and Receiving Feedback

Get feedback on your writing from fellow Inkhaven participants, both 1-1 and in group workshops. This can happen as frequently as you like – including every day!

### Mentorship

Share some of your essays with highly successful bloggers to discuss in a one-on-one setting, and get advice from them about the craft, your process, and what directions you want to grow as a writer.

### Writing Classes

Join workshops led by accomplished writers, on topics like research, editing, cultivating good comments, and more to be determined.

### Professional Support

Work with professional editors and writing coaches who will help you polish your work and overcome creative challenges.

All of these activities are optional; the only requirements are to (1) publish every day, and (2) be present at Lighthaven.

## At the Lighthaven Campus

Lighthaven is a beautiful venue designed for lots of small, quiet conversations in various nooks with whiteboards. It has bedrooms, offices, a gym, and gardens to write from.

> "Lighthaven felt rambly and wondrous and fun without being pretentious? Felt like an incredibly-well-executed, 11-of-10 house party venue (laudatory) crossed with Disneyland.
> 
> I am still learning about cool things and spaces in the venue that I missed (there was a robot sand table?)"

## Want to visit Inkhaven? Got something to offer?

We'd love to have excellent writers and/or relevant professionals contribute to Inkhaven.

*   Perhaps you're a professional in an area closely related to writing – an editor, a writing coach, a person who has helped run writers' workshops or retreats in the past – and you're available for some part of November for paid work.
*   Perhaps you're a successful writer and you'd like to spend time in the Inkhaven environment, get some writing done yourself, and help the residents with feedback on their writing, or teach a class.

If you'd like to contribute to Inkhaven in some way, express interest with the link below, and we'll get back to you!

We'll fly contributors out to Lighthaven, cover expenses and pay for their contributions.
