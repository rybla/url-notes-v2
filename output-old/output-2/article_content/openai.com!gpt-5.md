The user prompt says: “I was prescribed a statin tell me about statins and what questions should I ask at my follow up.” The response begins with “Searching for information on statin interactions and guidelines” followed by “Questions to bring to your follow-up.” The numbered list includes: (1) Pregnancy/breastfeeding plans (if relevant) and “What’s the plan?”; (2) Options if LDL goal isn’t reached, mentioning ezetimibe or PCSK9-targeting therapies; (3) Interactions/diet questions, such as grapefruit safety and supplements to avoid.
