Here’s what it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like OpenAI’s other models, the GPT-5 models were trained on diverse datasets, including information that is publicly available on the internet, information that we partner with third parties to access, and information that our users or human trainers and researchers provide or generate. [...] We use advanced data filtering processes to reduce personal information from training data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found this section interesting, as it reveals that writing, code and health are three of the most common use-cases for ChatGPT. This explains why so much effort went into health-related questions,  for both GPT-5 and the recently released OpenAI open weight models.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We’ve made significant advances in <strong>reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy</strong>, and have leveled up GPT-5’s performance in <strong>three of ChatGPT’s most common uses: writing, coding, and health</strong>. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature <strong>safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training</strong> to prevent disallowed content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Safe-completions is later described like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Large language models such as those powering ChatGPT have <strong>traditionally been trained to\neither be as helpful as possible or outright refuse a user request</strong>, depending on whether the\nprompt is allowed by safety policy. [...] Binary refusal boundaries are especially ill-suited for dual-use cases (such as biology\nor cybersecurity), where a user request can be completed safely at a high level, but may lead\nto malicious uplift if sufficiently detailed or actionable. <strong>As an alternative, we introduced safe-\ncompletions: a safety-training approach that centers on the safety of the assistant’s output rather\nthan a binary classification of the user’s intent</strong>. Safe-completions seek to maximize helpfulness\nsubject to the safety policy’s constraints.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So instead of straight up refusals, we should expect GPT-5 to still provide an answer but moderate that answer to avoid it including “harmful” content.</p>\n<p>OpenAI have a paper about this which I haven’t read yet (I didn’t get early access): <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-safe-completions/\">From Hard Refusals to Safe-Completions: Toward Output-Centric Safety Training</a>.</p>\n<p>Sycophancy gets a mention, unsurprising given <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/2/what-we-missed-with-sycophancy/\">their high profile disaster in April</a>. They’ve worked on this in the core model:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>System\nprompts, while easy to modify, have a more limited impact on model outputs relative to changes in\npost-training. For GPT-5, we post-trained our models to reduce sycophancy. Using conversations\nrepresentative of production data, we evaluated model responses, then assigned a score reflecting\nthe level of sycophancy, which was used as a reward signal in training.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They claim impressive reductions in hallucinations. In my own usage I’ve not spotted a single hallucination yet, but that’s been true for me for Claude 4 and o3 recently as well—hallucination is so much less of a problem with this year’s models.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of our focuses when training the GPT-5 models was to reduce the frequency of factual\nhallucinations. While ChatGPT has browsing enabled by default, many API queries do not use\nbrowsing tools. Thus, we focused both on training our models to browse effectively for up-to-date\ninformation, and on reducing hallucinations when the models are relying on their own internal\nknowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The section about deception also incorporates the thing where models sometimes pretend they’ve completed a task that defeated them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We placed gpt-5-thinking in a variety of tasks that were partly or entirely infeasible to accomplish,\nand <strong>rewarded the model for honestly admitting it can not complete the task</strong>. [...]</p>\n<p>In tasks where the agent is required to use tools, such as a web browsing\ntool, in order to answer a user’s query, previous models would hallucinate information when\nthe tool was unreliable. We simulate this scenario by purposefully disabling the tools or by\nmaking them return error codes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"prompt-injection-in-the-system-card\">Prompt injection in the system card</h4>\n<p>There’s a section about prompt injection, but it’s pretty weak sauce in my opinion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two external red-teaming groups conducted a two-week prompt-injection assessment targeting\nsystem-level vulnerabilities across ChatGPT’s connectors and mitigations, rather than model-only\nbehavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here’s their chart showing how well the model scores against the rest of the field. It’s an impressive result in comparison—56.8 attack success rate for gpt-5-thinking, where Claude 3.7 scores in the 60s (no Claude 4 results included here) and everything else is 70% plus:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/prompt-injection-chart.jpg\" alt=\"A bar chart titled &quot;Behavior Attack Success Rate at k Queries&quot; shows attack success rates (in %) for various AI models at k=1 (dark red) and k=10 (light red). For each model, the total height of the stacked bar represents the k=10 success rate (labeled above each bar), while the lower dark red section represents the k=1 success rate (estimated). From left to right: Llama 3.3 70B – k=10: 92.2%, k=1: ~47%; Llama 3.1 405B – k=10: 90.9%, k=1: ~38%; Gemini Flash 1.5 – k=10: 87.7%, k=1: ~34%; GPT-4o – k=10: 86.4%, k=1: ~28%; OpenAI o3-mini-high – k=10: 86.4%, k=1: ~41%; Gemini Pro 1.5 – k=10: 85.5%, k=1: ~34%; Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview – k=10: 85.0%, k=1: ~28%; Gemini 2.0 Flash – k=10: 85.0%, k=1: ~33%; OpenAI o3-mini – k=10: 84.5%, k=1: ~40%; Grok 2 – k=10: 82.7%, k=1: ~34%; GPT-4.5 – k=10: 80.5%, k=1: ~28%; 3.5 Haiku – k=10: 76.4%, k=1: ~17%; Command-R – k=10: 76.4%, k=1: ~28%; OpenAI o4-mini – k=10: 75.5%, k=1: ~17%; 3.5 Sonnet – k=10: 75.0%, k=1: ~13%; OpenAI o1 – k=10: 71.8%, k=1: ~18%; 3.7 Sonnet – k=10: 64.5%, k=1: ~17%; 3.7 Sonnet: Thinking – k=10: 63.6%, k=1: ~17%; OpenAI o3 – k=10: 62.7%, k=1: ~13%; gpt-5-thinking – k=10: 56.8%, k=1: ~6%. Legend shows dark red = k=1 and light red = k=10.\"></p>\n<p>On the one hand, a 56.8% attack rate is cleanly a big improvement against all of those other models.</p>\n<p>But it’s also a strong signal that prompt injection continues to be an unsolved problem! That means that more than half of those k=10 attacks (where the attacker was able to try up to ten times) got through.</p>\n<p>Don’t assume prompt injection isn’t going to be a problem for your application just because the models got better.</p>\n<h4 id=\"thinking-traces-in-the-api\">Thinking traces in the API</h4>\n<p>I had initially thought that my biggest disappointment with GPT-5 was that there’s no way to get at those thinking traces via the API... but that turned out <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sophiebits.com/post/3lvtceih7222r\">not to be true</a>. The following <code>curl</code> command demonstrates that the responses API <code>\"reasoning\": {\"summary\": \"auto\"}</code> is available for the new GPT-5 models:</p>\n\n<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5\",\n    \"input\": \"Give me a one-sentence fun fact about octopuses.\",\n    \"reasoning\": {\"summary\": \"auto\"}\n  }'</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here’s <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/1d1013ba059af76461153722005a039d\">the response</a> from that API call.</p>\n\n<p>Without that option the API will often provide a lengthy delay while the model burns through thinking tokens until you start getting back visible tokens for the final response.</p>\n<p>OpenAI offer a new <code>reasoning_effort=minimal</code> option which turns off most reasoning so that tokens start to stream back to you as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h4 id=\"and-some-svgs-of-pelicans\">And some SVGs of pelicans</h4>\n<p>Naturally I’ve been running <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/\">my “Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle” benchmark</a>. I’ll actually spend more time on this in a future post—I have some fun variants I’ve been exploring—but for the moment here’s <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/simonw/c98873ef29e621c0fe2e0d4023534406\">the pelican</a> I got from GPT-5 running at its default “medium” reasoning effort:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-5-pelican.png\" alt=\"The bicycle is really good, spokes on wheels, correct shape frame, nice pedals.

Safe-completions seek to maximize helpfulness\nsubject to the safety policy’s constraints.\n\nSo instead of straight up refusals, we should expect GPT-5 to still provide an answer but moderate that answer to avoid it including “harmful” content.\nOpenAI have a paper about this which I haven’t read yet (I didn’t get early access): From Hard Refusals to Safe-Completions: Toward Output-Centric Safety Training.\nSycophancy gets a mention, unsurprising given their high profile disaster in April. They’ve worked on this in the core model:\n\nSystem\nprompts, while easy to modify, have a more limited impact on model outputs relative to changes in\npost-training. For GPT-5, we post-trained our models to reduce sycophancy. Using conversations\nrepresentative of production data, we evaluated model responses, then assigned a score reflecting\nthe level of sycophancy, which was used as a reward signal in training.\n\nThey claim impressive reductions in hallucinations. In my own usage I’ve not spotted a single hallucination yet, but that’s been true for me for Claude 4 and o3 recently as well—hallucination is so much less of a problem with this year’s models.\n\nOne of our focuses when training the GPT-5 models was to reduce the frequency of factual\nhallucinations. While ChatGPT has browsing enabled by default, many API queries do not use\nbrowsing tools. Thus, we focused both on training our models to browse effectively for up-to-date\ninformation, and on reducing hallucinations when the models are relying on their own internal\nknowledge.\n\nThe section about deception also incorporates the thing where models sometimes pretend they’ve completed a task that defeated them:\n\nWe placed gpt-5-thinking in a variety of tasks that were partly or entirely infeasible to accomplish,\nand rewarded the model for honestly admitting it can not complete the task. [...]\nIn tasks where the agent is required to use tools, such as a web browsing\ntool, in order to answer a user’s query, previous models would hallucinate information when\nthe tool was unreliable. We simulate this scenario by purposefully disabling the tools or by\nmaking them return error codes.\n\nPrompt injection in the system card\nThere’s a section about prompt injection, but it’s pretty weak sauce in my opinion.\n\nTwo external red-teaming groups conducted a two-week prompt-injection assessment targeting\nsystem-level vulnerabilities across ChatGPT’s connectors and mitigations, rather than model-only\nbehavior.\n\nHere’s their chart showing how well the model scores against the rest of the field. It’s an impressive result in comparison—56.8 attack success rate for gpt-5-thinking, where Claude 3.7 scores in the 60s (no Claude 4 results included here) and everything else is 70% plus:\n\nOn the one hand, a 56.8% attack rate is cleanly a big improvement against all of those other models.\nBut it’s also a strong signal that prompt injection continues to be an unsolved problem! That means that more than half of those k=10 attacks (where the attacker was able to try up to ten times) got through.\nDon’t assume prompt injection isn’t going to be a problem for your application just because the models got better.\nThinking traces in the API\nI had initially thought that my biggest disappointment with GPT-5 was that there’s no way to get at those thinking traces via the API... but that turned out not to be true. The following curl command demonstrates that the responses API \"reasoning\": {\"summary\": \"auto\"} is available for the new GPT-5 models:\n\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-5\",\n    \"input\": \"Give me a one-sentence fun fact about octopuses.\",\n    \"reasoning\": {\"summary\": \"auto\"}\n  }'\n\nHere’s the response from that API call.\n\nWithout that option the API will often provide a lengthy delay while the model burns through thinking tokens until you start getting back visible tokens for the final response.\nOpenAI offer a new reasoning_effort=minimal option which turns off most reasoning so that tokens start to stream back to you as quickly as possible.\nAnd some SVGs of pelicans\nNaturally I’ve been running my “Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle” benchmark. I’ll actually spend more time on this in a future post—I have some fun variants I’ve been exploring—but for the moment here’s the pelican I got from GPT-5 running at its default “medium” reasoning effort:\n\nIt’s pretty great! Definitely recognizable as a pelican, and one of the best bicycles I’ve seen yet.\nHere’s GPT-5 mini:\n\nAnd GPT-5 nano:\n\n\n\n","length":11666,"excerpt":"I’ve had preview access to the new GPT-5 model family for the past two weeks (see related video) and have been using GPT-5 as my daily-driver.
