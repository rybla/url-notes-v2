Not by choice, really - I just couldn’t find a solution that didn’t suck.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Disqus? Slow, heavy, tracks users, and I don’t own anything.

Recently, the community has been feeling healthier than Twitter ever did, the API is designed, and this decentralized approach means I don’t necessarily have to be beholden to a single company. People have been doing some interesting things with Bluesky, like on-protocol blog content and using Bluesky comments as a comment system. Why not do some of that for myself?</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-bluesky-actually-makes-sense\">Why Bluesky Actually Makes Sense</h2>\n<p>The more I thought about it, the more directly using Bluesky for comments made sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>No infrastructure to maintain. (for me, at least) I don’t need to run databases, manage user accounts, or build moderation tools. Bluesky handles all of that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rich(er) content support. People can post images, links, and in threads. All the stuff that makes conversations interesting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Real identities. Since people are using their actual Bluesky profiles, and your one profile can <em>actually</em> be used on any supported platform, there’s more accountability and less incentive to drive-by troll.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-platform conversations. Comments live on Bluesky too, so people can discover my blog posts through social media and vice versa.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I own my content, they own theirs. No platform lock-in for anyone!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The workflow is simple: I publish a blog post, share it on Bluesky, edit the post to add the AT URI, and the replies to that Bluesky post become the comments on my blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"building-the-component\">Building the Component</h2>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-the-at-protocol\">Understanding the AT Protocol</h3>\n<p>Bluesky runs on the AT Protocol, which has surprisingly okay documentation. The key concepts I needed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DIDs</strong> (Decentralized Identifiers): Unique user IDs like <code>did:plc:abc123...</code> or <code>did:web:joe.coffee</code></li>\n<li><strong>CIDs</strong> (Content Identifiers): Unique post IDs</li>\n<li><strong>AT URIs</strong>: Addresses for content like <code>at://did:plc:user.../app.bsky.feed.post/postid</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To fetch comments, I just need to call the <code>getPostThread</code> endpoint with the right URI. No authentication required. Easy peasy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"component-architecture\">Component Architecture</h3>\n<p>I ended up with three main pieces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The main comments component that fetches and displays the thread.</li>\n<li>A reply component that handles rendering individual posts and their replies. Also includes metadata and a link to the original Bluesky post.</li>\n<li>An embed component for rich content like images and open graph previews.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This separation made each piece reasonably manageable, reasonable, and small.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-threading-challenge\">The Threading Challenge</h3>\n<p>The interesting part was handling nested replies. Bluesky threads can go arbitrarily deep, but I needed to display them in a way that’s readable and doesn’t break layouts.</p>\n<p>I settled on a naive recursive approach where each reply can render child replies, with visual indentation to show the hierarchy. I cap it at 5 levels deep because beyond that, conversations usually devolve into two people arguing anyway.</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"typescript\"><code><span><span>const</span><span> MAX_DEPTH </span><span>=</span><span> 5</span><span>;</span></span>\n<span><span>const</span><span> BlueskyReply</span><span> =</span><span> ({</span><span> thread</span><span>,</span><span> depth</span><span> =</span><span> 0</span><span> })</span><span> =&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>\n<span><span>  return</span><span> (</span></span>\n<span><span>    &lt;</span><span>div style</span><span>=</span><span>{{</span><span> marginLeft</span><span>:</span><span> depth </span><span>*</span><span> 12</span><span> }}</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span>      {</span><span>/* Render the post content */</span><span>}</span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span><span>      {</span><span>depth</span><span> &lt; </span><span>MAX_DEPTH</span><span> &amp;&amp; </span><span>thread</span><span>.</span><span>replies</span><span>?.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>reply</span><span> =&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span>        &lt;</span><span>BlueskyReply</span><span> thread</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>reply</span><span>}</span><span> depth</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>depth + </span><span>1</span><span>}</span><span> /&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span>      )</span><span>}</span></span>\n<span><span>    &lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span>  )</span><span>;</span></span>\n<span><span>};</span></span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"handling-rich-content\">Handling Rich Content</h3>\n<p>One of the nice things about Bluesky is that posts can contain more than just text. People embed images, external links, and even quote other posts. Each embed type needs special handling.</p>\n<p><strong>Images</strong> were the most complex. Bluesky serves them through their CDN, and people often post multiple images in a single reply.

I had the React integration (which I already had for my background and music components) and used the <code>client:load</code> directive to ensure the comment component hydrates immediately:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"astro\"><code><span><span>---</span></span>\n<span><span>import</span><span> BlueskyComments </span><span>from</span><span> '../components/bsky-comments.tsx'</span><span>;</span></span>\n<span><span>---</span></span>\n<span></span>\n<span><span>{</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>bsky </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> (</span></span>\n<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>BlueskyComments</span></span>\n<span><span>    did</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>bsky</span><span>.</span><span>did</span><span>}</span></span>\n<span><span>    postCid</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>bsky</span><span>.</span><span>postCid</span><span>}</span></span>\n<span><span>    client</span><span>:</span><span>load</span></span>\n<span><span>  /&gt;</span></span>\n<span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Now I just add this to any post’s frontmatter to enable comments:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"yaml\"><code><span><span>bsky</span><span>:</span></span>\n<span><span>  did</span><span>:</span><span> \"my-bluesky-did\"</span></span>\n<span><span>  postCid</span><span>:</span><span> \"the-post-id\"</span></span></code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-learned\">What I Learned</h2>\n<h3 id=\"typescript-is-your-friend\">TypeScript is Your Friend</h3>\n<p>There are proper TypeScript types for all their API responses through the <code>@atcute/client</code> package.
