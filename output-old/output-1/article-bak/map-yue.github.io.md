Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of\nmusic while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal\nmelodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through: (1) track-decoupled nexttoken prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning\nfor long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to\nconverge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for\nmusic generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into\nan English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation.\nThrough extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of\nthe proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables\nadditional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation,\nwe show that YuE’s learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks,\nwhere the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.</p>\n                    <!-- Video insertion starts here -->\n                    <p><img src=\"https://map-yue.github.io/Yue-main.png\">\n                    </p>\n                    <!-- Video insertion ends here -->\n                </div>\n            </div>\t\n<h2>YuE Model Checkpoints HF-Link</h2>\n<div>\n        <table>\n        <tbody><tr>\n            <th>S1-Model</th>\n            <th>COT</th>\n            <th>ICL</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>English</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-en-cot\">Link</a></td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-en-icl\">Link</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Chinese</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-zh-cot\">Link</a></td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-zh-icl\">Link</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Japanese &amp; Korean</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-jp-kr-cot\">Link</a></td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-jp-kr-icl\">Link</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>S2-Model</th>\n            <td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-s2-1B-general\">Link</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Upsampler</th>\n            <td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE-upsampler\">Link</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody></table>\n    </div>\n\n\t\n\n <div>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<h2>Examples</h2>\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    \n\n\n    \n    <div>\n        <p>Intro: The Model Song</p>\n        <p>YuE (乐) means \"music\" and \"happiness\" in Chinese.

beside me, no room for fear\nWalking through the streets, beats inside my head\nEvery step I take, closer to the bread\nPeople passing by, they don't understand\nBuilding up my future with my own two hands\n\n[chorus]\nThis is my life, and I'm aiming for the top\nNever gonna quit, no, I'm never gonna stop\nThrough the highs and lows, I'mma keep it real\nLiving out my dreams with this mic and a

would\n\n[chorus]\nThis is my journey, and I'm running this race\nHeart full of fire, you can see it in my face\nObstacles ahead, but I got no fear\nVictory is close, yeah, it's almost

damn\n\n[verse]\nEchoes in the alley, music's getting loud\nFeeling the adrenaline pumping through the crowd\nSpotlights on me, it's my time to shine\nLiving in the moment, everything's aligned\nLooking back now at the roads I've crossed\nEvery single battle, every line I've tossed\nMade me stronger, wiser, ready for what's next\nWriting my own story, turning pages of the text\n\n[chorus]\nThis is my song, and I'm singing it proud\nVoices united, hear us shout out loud\nFrom the underground straight into the stars\nCarving out my name, leaving all these scars\n\n[outro]\nYeah, this is for the dreamers, the ones who never quit\nKeep your head up high, and don't you ever submit\nLife is what you make it, so make it something great\nStep into your

Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of\nmusic while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal\nmelodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through: (1) track-decoupled nexttoken prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning\nfor long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to\nconverge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for\nmusic generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into\nan English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation.\nThrough extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of\nthe proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables\nadditional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation,\nwe show that YuE’s learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks,\nwhere the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                \n            \t\nYuE Model Checkpoints HF-Link\n\n        \n        \n            S1-Model\n            COT\n            ICL\n        \n        \n            English\n            Link\n            Link\n        \n        \n            Chinese\n            Link\n            Link\n        \n        \n            Japanese & Korean\n            Link\n            Link\n        \n        \n            S2-Model\n            Link\n        \n        \n            Upsampler\n            Link\n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\n\n \n\t\t\n\t\t\tExamples\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        Intro: The Model Song\n        YuE (乐) means \"music\" and \"happiness\" in Chinese.

here each day\nThis small lady with hair of grey\nAnd she merely grins and stumbles\nOn her way\n\n\n[verse]\nIn these hospital hallways\nShe strolls along these silent ways\nTo a chair\nWhere an old woman used to stay\nAnd an old woman used to pray\nI'm in the autumn of my days\n\n\n[verse]\nI've known the gladness\nI've known the stress\nI've just gone through the doctor's mess\nPlease don't sigh, my dear love mine\n\n\n\n[verse]\nHe arrived here not long past\nAnd the physicians were in doubt\nIf the moment for him to pass\nWas nigh\n\n\n[verse]\nBut when the time arrived\nAnd he closed his eyes to rest\nShe pleaded to the Lord above\nHis spirit to bless\nAnd as she turned away to grieve\nIt felt like she could sense\nI'm in the dawn of a new life\n\n\n[verse]\nI've known the gladness\nI've known the stress\nI've just faced the doctor's test\nPlease don't sigh, my dear love best\n\n\n[verse]\nShe'll stay there for quite a while\nAnd recall their love with a smile\nAnd set it there, the freshest flowers in style\n\n\n[verse]\nShe stands near that silent door\nHer tired heart is sore and worn\nAnd the tales that they once told\nStill ring in her ears so cold\n\n\n[chorus]\nI'm in the autumn of my life\nI've known the joy\nI've known the strife\nI've just come out of the sickroom light\nPlease don't sigh, my dear delight\n'Cause you and I, we've shared some light\n\n\n\n[chorus]\nAnd our love has reached far and wide\nAnd in the glow of stars at night\nYou and I will always unite\n\n\n[end]\n                \n            \n        \n
