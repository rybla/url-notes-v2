Not every organism needs oxygen, and many make their own food. But for all creatures, from deep-sea microbes and slime molds to trees and humans, water is nonnegotiable. “The first act of life was the capture of water within a cell membrane,” a pair of neurobiologists wrote in a recent review. Ever since, cells have had to stay wet enough to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Water is the medium in which all chemical reactions in an organism take place, and those reactions are finely tuned to a narrow range of ratios between water and salt, another essential ingredient in life’s chemistry. The cells in your body are permeable to water, so if the water-salt balance of the surrounding fluid — blood, lymph or cerebrospinal fluid, for example — is outside its healthy range, cells can swell or shrink, shrivel or potentially burst. An imbalance can cause brain cells to malfunction, losing their ability to manage ion concentrations across their membranes and propagate action potentials.</p>\n<p>Although these effects of insufficient water are felt by every cell in the body, cells themselves do not cry out in thirst. Instead, it’s the brain that monitors the body’s water levels and manifests the experience of thirst — a dry tongue, hot throat and rapid onset of malaise — which compels a behavior: acquire water.</p>\n<p>“These neural circuits that control hunger and thirst are located deep in primitive brain structures like the hypothalamus and brainstem,” said <a href=\"https://profiles.ucsf.edu/zachary.knight\">Zachary Knight</a>, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently co-authored <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.10.028\">a review paper in <em>Neuron</em></a> on the neurobiology of thirst.</p>\n</div>\n    </div>\n    <figure>\n        <div>\n                            <p><img width=\"2406\" height=\"1606\" src=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels.jpg\" alt=\"Two camels drink water\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels.jpg 2406w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels-1720x1148.jpg 1720w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels-520x347.jpg 520w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Camels-drinking-cr-Moaz-Tobok-CC0-Creative-Commons-license-via-Pexels-2048x1367.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2406px) 100vw, 2406px\">                </p>\n                        </div>\n        <figcaption>\n    <div>\n                            <p>Camels don’t experience thirst the same way we do: They burn fat stores or draw stored gallons from their stomachs when they need water.</p>\n            <p>Moaz Tobok CC0 Creative Commons license via Pexels</p>\n        </div>\n</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<div data-role=\"selectable\">\n    <p>Because these brain areas are difficult to study — due not only to their location, but also to their composition, with many different cell types and crisscrossed circuitry — it’s only in the last decade or so that neuroscientists have begun to understand how thirst fundamentally works.

Within a minute, these signals reach the brain and block the neurons in the OVLT and SFO that were activated to trigger thirst. The thirst response shuts off; the throat cools, and the mouth becomes moist again.</p>\n</div>\n    <figure>\n        <div>\n                            <p><img width=\"1543\" height=\"1939\" src=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tiger-Drinking-cr-Berrit-Watkin-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons.jpg\" alt=\"A tiger drinks water\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tiger-Drinking-cr-Berrit-Watkin-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons.jpg 1543w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tiger-Drinking-cr-Berrit-Watkin-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-1369x1720.jpg 1369w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tiger-Drinking-cr-Berrit-Watkin-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-414x520.jpg 414w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tiger-Drinking-cr-Berrit-Watkin-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-768x965.jpg 768w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tiger-Drinking-cr-Berrit-Watkin-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-1222x1536.jpg 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1543px) 100vw, 1543px\">                </p>\n                        </div>\n        <figcaption>\n    <div>\n                            <p>A tiger’s brain triggers the discomforts of thirst to motivate the cat to drink water.</p>\n            <p>Berrit Watkin, CC BY 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons</p>\n        </div>\n</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<div data-role=\"selectable\">\n    <p>Thirst, though, represents only one side of maintaining homeostasis. Salt — more specifically, sodium — is one of the most important things an animal consumes. Animals need sodium for neurons to fire action potentials, for proteins to keep their shape and function, and for chemical reactions to occur inside cells — the everyday business of life. We need to maintain a concentration of sodium ions in the fluids of our bodies to enable all those functions. It’s the other side of thirst.</p>\n<p>“There are only a couple of things that are so important for your body that there’s a completely innate drive to get it if you fall into deficiency,” Knight said. “Oxygen, food, water and sodium.”</p>\n<p>However, animals like us do not experience salt desire as a powerful, controlling drive as we do with oxygen, food and water. Sensors signal salt levels to the brain; in addition to the OVLT and SFO, sensors in the heart detect the stretching of atria and ventricles. But there is no analogous salt pang when we need it, the way a stomach churns for food or a scratchy throat cries out for water. Instead, the need to consume salt is mediated by taste and the brain’s reward pathways. “The taste of salt is bimodal,” Knight said. “It tastes good at low doses; at high doses it tastes disgusting, like drinking seawater.”</p>\n<p>Imagine the urge to eat a big bag of potato chips. If the body needs salt, those chips will cause a surge of pleasurable dopamine to flood the brain. If the body doesn’t need salt, that dopamine drip disappears. “It’s pretty much reinforcement learning,” said <a href=\"https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/yuki-oka\">Yuki Oka</a>, a neurobiologist at the California Institute of Technology who studies how the body maintains homeostasis. “More dopamine means a repeated behavior.”</p>\n<h2><strong>Everyone Thirsts Differently</strong></h2>\n<p>Scientists monitoring a river collect data and then have a choice about whether to act on their findings. Similarly, just because the brain measures the blood’s sodium levels doesn’t mean it has to act on that information.</p>\n<p>Take Elena Gracheva’s 13-lined ground squirrels. <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/elena-gracheva/\">Gracheva</a>, a neurophysiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, studies these rodents, native to North American grasslands, to understand how specific brain regions control thirst. The 13-lined ground squirrel is an ideal model for this, she said, because it hibernates for more than half the year, without eating or drinking. “They’re like monks,” Gracheva said. “They don’t go outside for eight months. They don’t have water in their underground burrow.” How do they not get thirsty?</p>\n</div>\n    <figure>\n        <div>\n                            <p><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1796\" src=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in a white shirt sitting on a red couch\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-1720x1207.jpg 1720w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-520x365.jpg 520w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-768x539.jpg 768w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-1536x1078.jpg 1536w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Elena-Gracheva-cr-Courtesy-of-the-Gracheva-Lab-v2-2048x1437.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\">                </p>\n                                <p><img width=\"2336\" height=\"1489\" src=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons.jpg\" alt=\"A thirteen-lined ground squirrel in grass\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons.jpg 2336w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-1720x1096.jpg 1720w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-520x331.jpg 520w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-768x490.jpg 768w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thirteen-lined-ground-squirrel-cr-Greg-Schechter-from-San-Francisco-USA-CC-BY-2.0-via-Wikimedia-Commons-2048x1305.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2336px) 100vw, 2336px\">                </p>\n                        </div>\n        <figcaption>\n    <div>\n                            <p>Elena Gracheva (left) has traced how the brains of 13-lined ground squirrels (right) suppress their thirst response during many months of hibernation.</p>\n            <p>(Left) Courtesy of Gracheva Lab, (Right) Greg Schechter CC-BY 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons</p>\n        </div>\n</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n<div data-role=\"selectable\">\n    <p>It isn’t that the squirrels don’t need water. They do. Their bodies cry out for it. But according to Gracheva’s research, during hibernation their brain ignores the body’s signals.</p>\n<p>In mammals, a drop in blood water levels (which means a simultaneous rise in salt concentration, all things being equal) triggers two coupled processes. The hypothalamus pumps out the hormone vasopressin, which tells the kidneys to retain water rather than let it out as urine, and the SFO kicks off the thirst drive to direct the animal to drink. However, while ground squirrels are hibernating, their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp8358\">vasopressin levels jump</a>, but the animal still doesn’t drink. “The circuit for vasopressin was normal, but thirst neurons were downregulated,” Gracheva said. “These two pathways are uncoupled.” The body is trying to retain the water it has but does not act to consume more.</p>\n<p>The logic of the disrupted circuitry is extremely powerful. “Even if you wake them up in the middle of hibernation, they’re not going to drink,” Gracheva said.</p>\n        \n        \n<p>The underlying network that Gracheva studies in squirrels is universal in mammals, up to and including humans. But that same neurological logic doesn’t lead to the same behaviors. Humans drink a glass of water when they’re thirsty. Cats and rabbits mostly get water from the food they eat. Camels can burn their fat stores for water (which produces carbon dioxide and water), but they also consume gallons of it and store it in their stomachs for when they need it later. Sea otters can drink ocean water and excrete urine that is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.204.11.1831\">saltier than the water they swim in</a>; they are the only marine mammals to actively do this.</p>\n<p>How each animal manages water and salt is specialized to its ecosystem, lifestyle and selective pressures. The question “What does it mean to be thirsty?” has no one answer. We each thirst in our own way.</p>\n</div>\n                \n                \n            </div>\n                <div id=\"newsletter\">\n            <p>\n                The Quanta Newsletter            </p>\n                            <p>\n                    <em>Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox</em>\n                </p>\n                        \n                            \n                    </div>\n    <div>\n            <h2>Also in <span>Biology</span></h2>\n            \n        </div>\n<section data-function=\"toggle\" data-name=\"show-comments\" id=\"comments\">\n    <h2>Comment on this article</h2>\n    \n    \n</section>\n    <div>\n        <div data-name=\"next-post__image-wrapper\">\n    <p><img width=\"1720\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2050/07/100-Years-of-Quantum-Mechanics-cr-Senor-Salme-HP-1720x728.webp\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2050/07/100-Years-of-Quantum-Mechanics-cr-Senor-Salme-HP-1720x728.webp 1720w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2050/07/100-Years-of-Quantum-Mechanics-cr-Senor-Salme-HP-520x220.webp 520w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2050/07/100-Years-of-Quantum-Mechanics-cr-Senor-Salme-HP-768x325.webp 768w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2050/07/100-Years-of-Quantum-Mechanics-cr-Senor-Salme-HP-1536x650.webp 1536w, https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2050/07/100-Years-of-Quantum-Mechanics-cr-Senor-Salme-HP-2048x867.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1720px) 100vw, 1720px\">    </p>\n</div>\n        \n        <div>\n                <h2>Next article</h2>\n                <p>‘It’s a Mess’: A Brain-Bending Trip to Quantum Theory’s 100th Birthday Party</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        </div></div>","textContent":"\n            \n            \n                \n        \n    \n    \n            \nAugust 11, 2025    \n    \n        \n            The effects of insufficient water are felt by every cell in the body, but it’s the brain that manifests our experience of thirst.        \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n            Introduction\n            \n    Water is the most fundamental need for all life on Earth.

Within a minute, these signals reach the brain and block the neurons in the OVLT and SFO that were activated to trigger thirst. The thirst response shuts off; the throat cools, and the mouth becomes moist again.\n\n    \n        \n                                            \n                        \n        \n    \n                            A tiger’s brain triggers the discomforts of thirst to motivate the cat to drink water.\n            Berrit Watkin, CC BY 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n        \n\n    \n\n    Thirst, though, represents only one side of maintaining homeostasis. Salt — more specifically, sodium — is one of the most important things an animal consumes. Animals need sodium for neurons to fire action potentials, for proteins to keep their shape and function, and for chemical reactions to occur inside cells — the everyday business of life. We need to maintain a concentration of sodium ions in the fluids of our bodies to enable all those functions. It’s the other side of thirst.\n“There are only a couple of things that are so important for your body that there’s a completely innate drive to get it if you fall into deficiency,” Knight said. “Oxygen, food, water and sodium.”\nHowever, animals like us do not experience salt desire as a powerful, controlling drive as we do with oxygen, food and water. Sensors signal salt levels to the brain; in addition to the OVLT and SFO, sensors in the heart detect the stretching of atria and ventricles. But there is no analogous salt pang when we need it, the way a stomach churns for food or a scratchy throat cries out for water. Instead, the need to consume salt is mediated by taste and the brain’s reward pathways. “The taste of salt is bimodal,” Knight said. “It tastes good at low doses; at high doses it tastes disgusting, like drinking seawater.”\nImagine the urge to eat a big bag of potato chips. If the body needs salt, those chips will cause a surge of pleasurable dopamine to flood the brain. If the body doesn’t need salt, that dopamine drip disappears. “It’s pretty much reinforcement learning,” said Yuki Oka, a neurobiologist at the California Institute of Technology who studies how the body maintains homeostasis. “More dopamine means a repeated behavior.”\nEveryone Thirsts Differently\nScientists monitoring a river collect data and then have a choice about whether to act on their findings. Similarly, just because the brain measures the blood’s sodium levels doesn’t mean it has to act on that information.\nTake Elena Gracheva’s 13-lined ground squirrels. Gracheva, a neurophysiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, studies these rodents, native to North American grasslands, to understand how specific brain regions control thirst. The 13-lined ground squirrel is an ideal model for this, she said, because it hibernates for more than half the year, without eating or drinking. “They’re like monks,” Gracheva said. “They don’t go outside for eight months. They don’t have water in their underground burrow.” How do they not get thirsty?\n\n    \n        \n                                            \n                                                \n                        \n        \n    \n                            Elena Gracheva (left) has traced how the brains of 13-lined ground squirrels (right) suppress their thirst response during many months of hibernation.\n            (Left) Courtesy of Gracheva Lab, (Right) Greg Schechter CC-BY 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons\n        \n\n    \n\n    It isn’t that the squirrels don’t need water. They do. Their bodies cry out for it. But according to Gracheva’s research, during hibernation their brain ignores the body’s signals.\nIn mammals, a drop in blood water levels (which means a simultaneous rise in salt concentration, all things being equal) triggers two coupled processes. The hypothalamus pumps out the hormone vasopressin, which tells the kidneys to retain water rather than let it out as urine, and the SFO kicks off the thirst drive to direct the animal to drink. However, while ground squirrels are hibernating, their vasopressin levels jump, but the animal still doesn’t drink. “The circuit for vasopressin was normal, but thirst neurons were downregulated,” Gracheva said. “These two pathways are uncoupled.” The body is trying to retain the water it has but does not act to consume more.\nThe logic of the disrupted circuitry is extremely powerful. “Even if you wake them up in the middle of hibernation, they’re not going to drink,” Gracheva said.\n        \n        \nThe underlying network that Gracheva studies in squirrels is universal in mammals, up to and including humans. But that same neurological logic doesn’t lead to the same behaviors. Humans drink a glass of water when they’re thirsty. Cats and rabbits mostly get water from the food they eat. Camels can burn their fat stores for water (which produces carbon dioxide and water), but they also consume gallons of it and store it in their stomachs for when they need it later. Sea otters can drink ocean water and excrete urine that is saltier than the water they swim in; they are the only marine mammals to actively do this.\nHow each animal manages water and salt is specialized to its ecosystem, lifestyle and selective pressures. The question “What does it mean to be thirsty?” has no one answer. We each thirst in our own way.\n\n                \n                \n            \n                \n            \n                The Quanta Newsletter            \n                            \n                    Get highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inbox\n                \n                        \n                            \n                    \n    \n            Also in Biology\n            \n        \n\n    Comment on this article\n    \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n\n        \n        \n                Next article\n                ‘It’s a Mess’: A Brain-Bending Trip to Quantum Theory’s 100th Birthday Party\n            \n        \n        ","length":11469,"excerpt":"The effects of insufficient water are felt by every cell in the body, but it’s the brain that manifests our experience of thirst.","siteName":"Quanta Magazine","publishedTime":"2025-08-11T14:41:43+00:00","url":"https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-does-it-mean-to-be-thirsty-20250811/","addedTime":"2025-08-12,00:40"}
