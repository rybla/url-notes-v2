You’re not coordinating keynote stages or passing off ideas to an agency. You’re the one planning developer happy hours, running trade show booths end-to-end, and figuring out how to create moments that developers actually care about.\nYou’ll own our IRL presence. That includes two to three major trade shows each year, a rotating calendar of smaller developer events, and any opportunity to deepen our presence and trust in the communities that matter, online and off.\nWhat you’ll do\nOwn Depot’s entire in-person event strategy, from small developer meetups to our 2–3 major trade shows each year\nManage every trade show detail end-to-end including logistics, booth setup, demo flow, messaging, staffing, swag, and real developer engagement\nPlan and run developer gatherings like happy hours, unconferences, or fringe events around larger industry moments\nBuild scalable playbooks for scrappy IRL events, so we can move fast and replicate what works\nWork with design to bring physical spaces and swag to life in ways that feel native to developer culture\nIdentify and grow our presence in developer spaces we don’t yet own\nKeep us ahead of what’s happening in the community: what events are worth attending, where our voice matters, and who we should be collaborating with\nTrack and report on event impact, not just in lead gen but in presence, credibility, and developer buzz\nBuild lasting relationships with developers by showing up consistently and creating experiences they’ll actually remember\nSkills & Experience\n3+ years experience running developer-focused events, including trade shows, meetups, or other in-person activations\nProven ability to manage complex logistics, tight timelines, and shifting priorities without losing the thread on experience quality\nStrong familiarity with developer culture and community dynamics\nComfortable working cross-functionally to bring events to life\nClear communicator who can keep stakeholders aligned without overcomplicating things\nPrior experience at a startup or in a fast-moving environment is a plus\nSelf-starter with prior startup or fast-moving team experience, comfortable operating remotely and asynchronously\nDepot values and culture\nWe are a fully remote and globally distributed team across the US, Europe, and Canada. As a startup focused on iteration speed and technical depth, we care deeply about how people work together.\nWe look for self starters. Part of working in a startup is being able to self navigate the ambiguity and take meaningful action to keep the momentum moving forward. There is no shortage of fun, hard, interesting things to work on, but you need to be self motivated to pick them up and go.\nWe’re transparent. We do not hide how the business is doing or what the tradeoffs are. Internally and externally, we tell the truth about how things work and where they break.\nWe’re data driven. We track performance to the second. We ship benchmarks with methodology. A decision without data is just a theory.\nWe’re relentlessly helpful. We meet developers where they are and help them move faster. Inside the company, we take the same approach with each other.\nWe do more with less. We maximize impact through efficiency and resourcefulness. We value folks who can ruthlessly prioritize and take action. Constraints drive innovation, not limitation.\nWe’re not your family. We’re a team. We expect you to get things done and contribute meaningfully, and also to protect your time, rest, and personal life.
