Electrophoretic displays stand out for their unique qualities: they are easy on the eyes, mimic the aesthetics of paper, conserve power when idle, and offer high contrast with wide viewing angles even in direct sunlight.</p>\n<p>In recent years, improvements in e-paper technology have expanded its applications beyond traditional e-readers. Despite these advancements, however, key challenges still hold back widespread adoption of e-paper devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proprietary Hardware and Software:</strong> Most e-paper devices operate on closed, proprietary systems.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Standards:</strong> There is a shortage of best practices and guidelines for designing user interfaces optimized for e-paper.</li>\n<li><strong>High Costs:</strong> The expense of e-paper panels limits experimentation and broader adoption.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We built the Modos Developer Kit to allow engineers, product designers, programmers, and enthusiasts to re-purpose e-paper screens in creative ways. We’re also building a community that’s committed to establishing the standards, best practices, and guidelines needed to realize the full potential of e-paper technology.

By dividing the screen into multiple update regions, the Caster processes and displays new images or text instantly, without waiting for previous updates to complete. Each pixel is managed independently, and early cancellation techniques ensure that pixels update as soon as new data is available. The result is smooth, responsive performance with high frame rates and superior contrast, ideal for dynamic content and fluid interactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compatible-with-a-variety-of-screens\">Compatible With a Variety of Screens</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/caf2/70975223-7b9f-4180-9d19-4103f316caf2/modos-mono-color-16x9_jpg_gallery-lg.jpg\" data-thumbnail-path=\"/img/caf2/70975223-7b9f-4180-9d19-4103f316caf2/modos-mono-color-16x9_jpg_gallery-thumb.jpg\">\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/caf2/70975223-7b9f-4180-9d19-4103f316caf2/modos-mono-color-16x9_jpg_md-xl.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"1600\">\n  </a>\n\n\n  </p>\n\n<p>Got a spare e-paper screen gathering dust or looking to re-purpose a display for your project? Our Developer Kit makes it simple. Compatible with a wide range of screens—from 6-inch up to 13.3-inch, in both monochrome and color—the kit lets you easily connect and reuse unused displays. With our monitor enclosure design files, you can build a custom monitor housing that perfectly fits your project’s needs.</p>\n<p>Explore our <a href=\"https://github.com/Modos-Labs/Glider?tab=readme-ov-file#screen-list\">GitHub repository</a> for a complete list of compatible screens.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-defined-modes-api\">User-Defined Modes &amp; API</h2><div>\n  <p>\n    <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6B4tSAdm21w?start=&amp;end=&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;playsinline=0&amp;fs=0&amp;disablekb=0&amp;controls=1&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>While commercial e-paper products rely on preset driving strategies (text, graphics, video modes) to cope with the technology’s limitations, our Developer Kit goes further. It offers full customization so you can tailor the display experience to your specific needs.</p>\n<p>For example, the Hybrid Greyscale Mode allows the Caster to switch between a fast binary mode for quick updates and a slower, detailed greyscale mode for refined rendering. This minimizes latency and visual flashing by updating in binary first, then refining in greyscale as the image stabilizes.</p>\n<p>With our C API, you gain direct control over screen and mode selection, letting you optimize the display for a wide range of applications. Our broader vision includes developing native e-paper applications and a protocol for seamless mode transitions based on content type.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features-specifications\">Features &amp; Specifications</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/874a/64da1b5f-5a13-4eaa-88ba-3aa3f973874a/modos-pcb-front-back-01_jpg_gallery-lg.jpg\" data-thumbnail-path=\"/img/874a/64da1b5f-5a13-4eaa-88ba-3aa3f973874a/modos-pcb-front-back-01_jpg_gallery-thumb.jpg\">\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.crowdsupply.com/img/874a/64da1b5f-5a13-4eaa-88ba-3aa3f973874a/modos-pcb-front-back-01_jpg_md-xl.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"1600\">\n  </a>\n\n\n  </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driver-board-hardware-reference-design\">Driver Board Hardware Reference Design</h3><ul>\n<li>Xilinx Spartan-6 LX16 FPGA running Caster gateware</li>\n<li>DDR3-800 framebuffer memory</li>\n<li>Video input supporting:<ul>\n<li>USB Type-C DisplayPort Alt-Mode with on-board PTN3460 decoder</li>\n<li>DVI (via microHDMI connector) video input with on-board ADV7611 decoder</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>E-paper power supply with up to 1 A peak current on the ±15 V rail to support large panel sizes.</li>\n<li>VCOM kick-back voltage measurement support</li>\n<li>On-board STM32H750 microcontroller for USB communication, firmware upgrades, and standalone applications.

Electrophoretic displays stand out for their unique qualities: they are easy on the eyes, mimic the aesthetics of paper, conserve power when idle, and offer high contrast with wide viewing angles even in direct sunlight.\nIn recent years, improvements in e-paper technology have expanded its applications beyond traditional e-readers. Despite these advancements, however, key challenges still hold back widespread adoption of e-paper devices:\n\nProprietary Hardware and Software: Most e-paper devices operate on closed, proprietary systems.\nLack of Standards: There is a shortage of best practices and guidelines for designing user interfaces optimized for e-paper.\nHigh Costs: The expense of e-paper panels limits experimentation and broader adoption.\n\nWe built the Modos Developer Kit to allow engineers, product designers, programmers, and enthusiasts to re-purpose e-paper screens in creative ways. We’re also building a community that’s committed to establishing the standards, best practices, and guidelines needed to realize the full potential of e-paper technology. Join us on Discord and by following us on Mastodon, Bluesky, Matrix, and Twitter.\nHigh Refresh Rate\n  \n    \n  \n\nOur Developer Kit leverages Caster, an open-source FPGA-based electrophoretic display controller engineered for low-latency performance and capable of driving e-paper screens at up to 60 Hz. By dividing the screen into multiple update regions, the Caster processes and displays new images or text instantly, without waiting for previous updates to complete. Each pixel is managed independently, and early cancellation techniques ensure that pixels update as soon as new data is available. The result is smooth, responsive performance with high frame rates and superior contrast, ideal for dynamic content and fluid interactions.\nCompatible With a Variety of Screens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\nGot a spare e-paper screen gathering dust or looking to re-purpose a display for your project? Our Developer Kit makes it simple. Compatible with a wide range of screens—from 6-inch up to 13.3-inch, in both monochrome and color—the kit lets you easily connect and reuse unused displays. With our monitor enclosure design files, you can build a custom monitor housing that perfectly fits your project’s needs.\nExplore our GitHub repository for a complete list of compatible screens.\nUser-Defined Modes & API\n  \n    \n  \n\nWhile commercial e-paper products rely on preset driving strategies (text, graphics, video modes) to cope with the technology’s limitations, our Developer Kit goes further. It offers full customization so you can tailor the display experience to your specific needs.\nFor example, the Hybrid Greyscale Mode allows the Caster to switch between a fast binary mode for quick updates and a slower, detailed greyscale mode for refined rendering. This minimizes latency and visual flashing by updating in binary first, then refining in greyscale as the image stabilizes.\nWith our C API, you gain direct control over screen and mode selection, letting you optimize the display for a wide range of applications. Our broader vision includes developing native e-paper applications and a protocol for seamless mode transitions based on content type.\nFeatures & Specifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\nDriver Board Hardware Reference Design\nXilinx Spartan-6 LX16 FPGA running Caster gateware\nDDR3-800 framebuffer memory\nVideo input supporting:\nUSB Type-C DisplayPort Alt-Mode with on-board PTN3460 decoder\nDVI (via microHDMI connector) video input with on-board ADV7611 decoder\n\n\nE-paper power supply with up to 1 A peak current on the ±15 V rail to support large panel sizes.\nVCOM kick-back voltage measurement support\nOn-board STM32H750 microcontroller for USB communication, firmware upgrades, and standalone applications.

We are confident in the robustness of our final product.\nThat said, as with any hardware project, the production process and supply-chain management present inherent risks. To mitigate these risks, we have built strong partnerships with our suppliers and manufacturers. In the event of any setbacks, we are committed to minimizing delays and will keep our backers informed with transparent, timely updates throughout the process.\nThank You to the NLnet Foundation and the NGI Zero Etrust FundOur team would like to acknowledge partial funding for development of Caster from the NGI0 Entrust Fund, a fund established by NLnet with financial support from the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n    \n    \n        In the Press\n\n          \n              \n              \n              \n                Hackster News\n                \"The idea behind the Modos Paper Monitor... is to provide a more eye-friendly display than the backlit LCD panels commonly in use. \"\n              \n            \n          \n              \n              \n              \n                Tom's Hardware\n                \"This project is the brainchild of Alexander Soto, who describes a journey starting in February 2021 to defeat the eyestrain that comes with daily extended use of standard displays.\"\n              \n            \n\n            \n          \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n          \n          \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n          \n\n      \n\n\n      \n  \n\n\n      \n  \n        Produced by Modos Tech in Boston, MA.\n        Sold and shipped by Crowd Supply.\n      \n\n      \n  \n        \n  \n      \n      \n      \n        6\" Modos Paper Dev Kit\n\n\n        Pre-assembled development kit for the 6-inch version of our low-latency, 1448 x 1072 e-paper display.
