The AI completes my sentences, predicts meeting times, memorizes how I write tasks. But if all these AI companies disappear tomorrow, my system still works. It’s just a text file. The AI makes it faster, not required.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s fast</strong>: Adding a task burns 2 seconds. No clicking through menus or selecting projects.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s searchable</strong>: Cmd+F and I find anything instantly. “When did I last call the dentist?” Search for “dentist”. Done.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s mine</strong>: No company can kill it. No updates can destroy it. No algorithm decides what I should see.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s honest</strong>: I can’t hide behind fancy features. Either I did the thing or I didn’t.</p>\n<p><strong>It lasts forever</strong>: A text file is the most basic thing a computer can read. It’ll work after every software update, every company shutdown, every app that stops working. Text files from 20 years ago still open perfectly. Try that with your Notion workspace.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-secret-sauce\">The Secret Sauce</h2>\n<p>Productivity isn’t about finding the perfect app. It’s about:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dumping things onto paper so your brain can forget them</li>\n<li>Checking the list regularly</li>\n<li>Executing the tasks</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s it.
